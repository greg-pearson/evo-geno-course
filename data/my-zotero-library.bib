  abstract = {From bacteria to mammals, nearly all organisms have adapted their physiology and behavior to a daily rhythm. These circadian (daily) rhythms influence virtually all aspects of physiological architecture (i.e., from gene expression to organismal behavior). Therefore, it is not surprising that several features of the immune response are regulated in a time-of-day dependent manner. The field of chrono-immunology has expanded tremendously over the past decade. In this abridged review, we present studies from the past five years that have revealed new parameters of the immune system that demonstrate daily variations in the control of pathogens and response to microbial components. These studies analyzed how the disruption of circadian rhythms impairs immune function, how microbial components alter the circadian clock, and how immune responses demonstrate daily variations in human subjects. Further elucidating the intricate connections between the circadian clock and the immune system will hopefully provide opportunities for chrono-immunotherapy in disease treatment and prevention.},

  abstract = {Research on circadian rhythms often requires researchers to estimate period, robustness/power, and phase of the rhythm. These are important to estimate, owing to the fact that they act as readouts of different features of the underlying clock. The commonly used tools, to this end, suffer from being very expensive, having very limited interactivity, being very cumbersome to use, or a combination of these. As a step toward remedying the inaccessibility to users who may not be able to afford them and to ease the analysis of biological time-series data, we have written RhythmicAlly, an open-source program using R and Shiny that has the following advantages: (1) it is free, (2) it allows subjective marking of phases on actograms, (3) it provides high interactivity with graphs, (4) it allows visualization and storing of data for a batch of individuals simultaneously, and (5) it does what other free programs do but with fewer mouse clicks, thereby being more efficient and user-friendly. Moreover, our program can be used for a wide range of ultradian, circadian, and infradian rhythms from a variety of organisms, some examples of which are described here. The first version of RhythmicAlly is available on Github, and we aim to maintain the program with subsequent versions having updated methods of visualizing and analyzing time-series data.},

  abstract = {The immune system is regulated by circadian clocks within the brain and immune cells. Environmental circadian disruption (ECD), consisting of a 6-h phase advance of the light:dark cycle once a week for 4 weeks, elevates the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) both in vivo and in vitro. This indicates that circadian disruption adversely affects immune function; however, it remains unclear how the circadian system regulates this response under ECD conditions. Here, we develop an assay using ex vivo whole-blood LPS challenge to investigate the circadian regulation of immune responses in mice and to determine the effects of ECD on these rhythms. LPS-induced IL-6 release in whole blood was regulated in a circadian manner, peaking during subjective day under both entrained and free-running conditions. This LPS-induced IL-6 release rhythm was associated with daily variation in both white blood cell counts and immune cell responsiveness. ECD increased the overall level of LPS-induced IL-6 release by increasing immune cell responsiveness and not by affecting immune cell number or the circadian regulation of this rhythm. This indicates that ECD produces pathological immune responses by increasing the proinflammatory responses of immune cells. Also, this newly developed whole blood assay can provide a noninvasive longitudinal method to quantify potential health consequences of circadian disruption in humans.},

Both the olfactory and trigeminal nerves innervate the nasal cavity and are potential portals of virus entry into the CNS. To evaluate the relative importance of each nerve for MHV infection, mice were infected under conditions that discriminated between trigeminal and olfactory nerve entry. When olfactory nerve entry was selectively eliminated by surgical removal of both olfactory bulbs or by chemical destruction of the olfactory epithelium, MHV-JHM spread into the CNS was completely prevented. On the other hand, direct inoculation into the olfactory bulb, which eliminates all entry via the trigeminal nerve, had no effect on the pattern of virus infection. Thus MHV-JHM enters the CNS via the olfactory nerve after intranasal inoculation while entry via the trigeminal nerve is an insignificant part of this process.},

Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.},

However, no studies have examined how pro-inflammatory IL-6 trans-signaling is involved in the exaggerated production of IL-6 in the aged brain, nor the extent to which IL-6 trans-signaling affects other markers of neuroinflammation, adhesion molecules, and behavior. Therefore, this study investigated in aged mice the presence of IL-6 signaling subunits in microglia; the central effects of soluble gp130 (sgp130)\textemdash a natural inhibitor of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway\textemdash on IL-6 production in microglia; and the effects of sgp130 given intracerebroventricularly (ICV) on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior caused by i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we show that microglia isolated from aged mice have higher expression of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) compared to microglia from adults; and the level of mRNA for ADAM17, the enzyme responsible for shedding membrane-bound IL-6R in trans-signaling, is higher in the hippocampus of aged mice compared to adults. Additionally, we show in aged mice that peripheral LPS challenge elicits a hyperactive IL-6 response in microglia, and selective blockade of trans-signaling by ICV injection of sgp130 mitigates this. The sgp130-associated inhibition of IL-6 was paralleled by amelioration of exaggerated and protracted sickness behavior in aged mice. Taken together, the results show that microglia are important regulators of the IL-6 trans-signaling response in the aged brain and sgp130 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory arm of IL-6 signaling.},

CRs in multiple aspects of immune function are impaired in rodents that have been rendered circadian-arrhythmic through various methods. In Siberian hamsters, circadian arrhythmia can be induced by disruptive light treatments (DPS). Here we examined CRs in wound healing, and the effects of circadian disruption on wound healing in DPS-arrhythmic hamsters. Circadian entrained/rhythmic (RHYTH) and behaviorally-arrhythmic (ARR) female hamsters were administered a cutaneous wound either 3h after light onset (ZT03) or 2h after dark onset (ZT18); wound size was quantified daily using image analyses. Among RHYTH hamsters, ZT03 wounds healed faster than ZT18 wounds, whereas in ARR hamsters, circadian phase did not affect wound healing. In addition, wounds healed slower in ARR hamsters. The results document a clear CR in wound healing, and indicate that the mere presence of organismal circadian organization enhances this aspect of immune function. Faster wound healing in CR-competent hamsters may be mediated by CR-driven coordination of the temporal order of mechanisms (inflammation, leukocyte trafficking, tissue remodeling) underlying cutaneous wound healing.},

  abstract = {Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are often associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, yet the impact of virus replication and immune cell recruitment on BBB integrity are incompletely understood. Using two-photon microscopy, we demonstrate that Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) strain TC83-GFP, a GFP expressing, attenuated strain with a G3A mutation within the 5{${'}$} UTR that is associated with increased sensitivity to type I interferons (IFNs), does not directly impact BBB permeability. Following intranasal infection of both wild-type and IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1)-deficient mice, which fail to block TC83-specific RNA translation, virus spreads to the olfactory bulb and cortex via migration along axonal tracts of neurons originating from the olfactory neuroepithelium. Global dissemination of virus in the CNS by 2days post-infection (dpi) was associated with increased BBB permeability in the olfactory bulb, but not in the cortex or hindbrain, where permeability only increased after the recruitment of CX3CR1+ and CCR2+ mononuclear cells on 6 dpi, which corresponded with tight junction loss and claudin 5 redistribution. Importantly, despite higher levels of viral replication, similar results were obtained in IFIT1-deficient mice. These findings indicate that TC83 gains CNS access via anterograde axonal migration without directly altering BBB function and that mononuclear and endothelial cell interactions may underlie BBB disruption during alphavirus encephalitis.},

  abstract = {IL-6 is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS. IL-6 signals via binding to either the membrane bound IL-6R{$\alpha$} (classic signaling) or soluble (s)IL-6Ra (trans-signaling) that then form a complex with gp130 to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The importance of classic versus trans-signaling in mediating IL-6 actions in the living CNS is relatively unknown and was the focus of this investigation. Bigenic mice (termed GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice) were generated with CNS-restricted, astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 and coproduction of the specific inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling, human sgp130-Fc. Transgene-encoded IL-6 mRNA levels were similar in the brain of GFAP-IL6 and GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice. However, GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice had decreased pY705-STAT3 in the brain due to a reduction in the total number of pY705-STAT3-positive cells and a marked loss of pY705-STAT3 in specific cell types. Blockade of trans-signaling in the brain of the GFAP-IL6 mice significantly attenuated Serpina3n but not SOCS3 gene expression, whereas vascular changes including angiogenesis and blood\textendash brain barrier leakage as well as gliosis were also reduced significantly. Hippocampal neurogenesis which was impaired in GFAP-IL6 mice was rescued in young GFAP-IL6 mice with cerebral sgp130 production. Finally, degenerative changes in the cerebellum characteristic of GFAP-IL6 mice were absent in GFAP-IL6/sgp130 mice. The findings indicate that in the CNS: (1) sgp130 is able to block IL-6 trans-signaling, (2) trans-signaling is important for IL-6 cellular communication with selective cellular and molecular targets, and (3) blocking of trans-signaling alleviates many of the detrimental effects of IL-6.},

Here we briefly review the main characteristics of FAA.

An example of a circadian behaviour common to most organisms is the feeding/fasting cycle, which shapes whole-body metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms by which the clock controls cellular metabolism have only recently become clear. The molecular clock and related metabolic pathways are also key drivers of immunity. Thus, a natural convergence of circadian biology, metabolism, and immunology has emerged to form a new field that we term `circadian immunometabolism'. Expanding our understanding of this field will provide insights into chronic conditions such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis.},

Chronic disruption of circadian timing in shift work or during chronic jet lag in animal models leads to a higher risk of several pathologies. Many of these conditions in both shift workers and experimental models share the common risk factor of inflammation. In this study, we show that experimentally induced circadian disruption altered innate immune responses. Endotoxemic shock induced by LPS was magnified, leading to hypothermia and death after four consecutive weekly 6-h phase advances of the light/dark schedule, with 89\% mortality compared with 21\% in unshifted control mice. This may be due to a heightened release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS treatment in shifted animals. Isolated peritoneal macrophages harvested from shifted mice exhibited a similarly heightened response to LPS in vitro, indicating that these cells are a target for jet lag. Sleep deprivation and stress are known to alter immune function and are potential mediators of the effects we describe. However, polysomnographic recording in mice exposed to the shifting schedule revealed no sleep loss, and stress measures were not altered in shifted mice. In contrast, we observed altered or abolished rhythms in the expression of clock genes in the central clock, liver, thymus, and peritoneal macrophages in mice after chronic jet lag. We conclude that circadian disruption, but not sleep loss or stress, are associated with jet lag-related dysregulation of the innate immune system. Such immune changes might be a common mechanism for the myriad negative health effects of shift work.},

Pan-cancer analyses have revealed that stemness of cancer cells correlates positively with immunosuppressive pathways in many solid tumors, including GBM, prompting us to conduct a gain-of-function screen of epigenetic regulators that may influence GSC self-renewal and tumor immunity. The circadian regulator CLOCK emerged as a top hit in enhancing stem cell self-renewal, which was amplified in about 5\% of human GBM cases. CLOCK and its heterodimeric partner BMAL1 enhanced GSC self-renewal and triggered pro-tumor immunity via transcriptional up-regulation of OLFML3, a novel chemokine recruiting immune-suppressive microglia into the tumor microenvironment. In GBM models, CLOCK or OLFML3 depletion reduced intratumoral microglia density and extended overall survival. We conclude that the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex contributes to key GBM hallmarks of GSC maintenance and immunosuppression and, together with its downstream target OLFML3, represents new therapeutic targets for this disease.},

Depletion of microglia during encephalitis results in enhanced virus spread and increased lethality. Activation, proliferation, and accumulation of microglia are regulated by type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia. Morphological analysis of myeloid cells shows that type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons has a stronger impact on the activation of myeloid cells than of astrocytes.

  abstract = {Cell death is prevalent throughout life; however, the coordinated interactions and roles of phagocytes during corpse removal in the live brain are poorly understood. We developed photochemical and viral methodologies to induce death in single cells and combined this with intravital optical imaging. This approach allowed us to track multicellular phagocytic interactions with precise spatiotemporal resolution. Astrocytes and microglia engaged with dying neurons in an orchestrated and synchronized fashion. Each glial cell played specialized roles: Astrocyte processes rapidly polarized and engulfed numerous small dendritic apoptotic bodies, while microglia migrated and engulfed the soma and apical dendrites. The relative involvement and phagocytic specialization of each glial cell was plastic and controlled by the receptor tyrosine kinase Mertk. In aging, there was a marked delay in apoptotic cell removal. Thus, a precisely orchestrated response and cross-talk between glial cells during corpse removal may be critical for maintaining brain homeostasis.
Astrocytes and microglia have specialized roles and display a coordinated response during corpse removal in the live brain.

  abstract = {Type I interferons, also referred to as IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, form the first line of defense against viral infections. Major IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} producers in the periphery are the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Constitutive expression of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-7 enables pDCs to rapidly synthesize large amounts of IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} after viral infection. In the central nervous system (CNS), pDCs are considered to be absent from the parenchyma, and little is known about the cells producing IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}. The study presented here aimed to identify the cells producing IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} in the CNS in vivo after infection by neurotropic viruses such as Theiler's virus and La Crosse virus. No cells with high constitutive expression of IRF-7 were detected in the CNS of uninfected mice, suggesting the absence of cells equivalent to pDCs. Upon viral infection, IFN-{$\beta$} and some subtypes of IFN-{$\alpha$}, but not IFN-{$\epsilon$} or IFN-{$\kappa$}, were transcriptionally up-regulated. IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} was predominantly produced by scattered parenchymal cells and much less by cells of inflammatory foci. Interestingly, in addition to some macrophages and ependymal cells, neurons turned out to be important producers of both IFN-{$\alpha$} and IFN-{$\beta$}. However, only 3\% of the infected neurons produced IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, suggesting that some restriction to IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} production existed in these cells. All CNS cell types analyzed, including neurons, were able to respond to type I IFN by producing Mx or IRF-7. Our data show that, in vivo, neurons take an active part to the antiviral defense by being both IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} producers and responders.},

  abstract = {Winter is often stressful. Increased energetic demands in winter and concurrent reductions in energy availability can lead to an energetic imbalance and compromise survival. To increase the odds of surviving winter, individuals of some nontropical rodent species have evolved mechanisms to enhance immune function in advance of harsh winter conditions. Short day lengths provide a proximate cue for enhancement of immune function, an adaptive functional response to counter environmental stress-induced reduction in immune function. In the present study, photoperiod, ambient temperature, and food availability were manipulated and reproductive function and cell-mediated immunity were assessed in adult male deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Mice maintained in short days regressed their reproductive systems and displayed enhanced immune function compared to long-day animals. Reduced food availability elevated corticosterone concentrations and suppressed reproductive and immune function, whereas ambient temperature alone had no effect on cell-mediated immunity. The suppressive effect of food restriction on reproductive and immune function was overcome by maintaining animals in short days. However, short-day, food-restricted mice maintained at low ambient temperatures displayed reduced reproductive and immune function compared to animals maintained at mild temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest that short-day enhancement of immune function can counteract some, but not all, of the immunosuppressive effects of winter stressors. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that immune function is enhanced in short days to counteract stress-mediated immune suppression occurring during winter.},

In experiment 2, female deer mice were ovariectomized, ovariectomized and given estrogen replacement, or sham-operated. Animals from each of these experimental groups were subsequently housed in either LD 16:8 or LD 8:16 for 10 weeks. Short-day deer mice underwent reproductive regression and displayed reduced serum estradiol concentrations and elevated lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A, as compared to long-day mice. Surgical manipulation had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation in either male or female deer mice. Neither photoperiod nor surgical manipulation affected serum corticosterone concentrations. These results confirm that both male and female deer mice housed in short days enhance immune function relative to long-day animals.

To address whether local type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) triggering plays a role in controlling virus replication within the brain, we generated mice with a cell type-specific IFNAR deletion in neuroectodermal cells of the CNS (NesCre+/-IFNARflox/flox). Intranasal VSV infection with 103 PFU was well tolerated by wild-type mice, whereas conventional IFNAR-/- mice died within 2\textendash 3 days. In contrast, brain-specific NesCre+/-IFNARflox/flox mice survived until day 5\textendash 6 and then became hemiplegic and died. Terminally ill NesCre+/-IFNARflox/flox mice showed 10- to 100-fold higher virus loads in the brain than IFNAR-/- mice, whereas little or no virus was found in other organs. In wild-type animals, virus could be reisolated only from the olfactory bulb until day 6 where also STAT1 activation as a measure of IFNAR triggering was detected. Virus infection was found exclusively in glomerular structures of the olfactory bulb, whereas surrounding cells that showed STAT1 phosphorylation as a measure of IFNAR trigging were free of virus. Our data indicate that upon intranasal VSV instillation, early and localized IFNAR triggering in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb is critically required to prevent viral spread over the entire CNS and thus confers survival.},

  abstract = {Previously we found that following intranasal (i.n.) infection with neurotropic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) triggering of neuroectodermal cells was critically required to constrain intracerebral virus spread. To address whether locally active IFN-{$\beta$} was induced proximally, we studied spatiotemporal conditions of VSV-mediated IFN-{$\beta$} induction. To this end, we performed infection studies with IFN-{$\beta$} reporter mice. One day after intravenous (i.v.) VSV infection, luciferase induction was detected in lymph nodes. Upon i.n. infection, luciferase induction was discovered at similar sites with delayed kinetics, whereas on days 3 and 4 postinfection enhanced luciferase expression additionally was detected in the foreheads of reporter mice. A detailed analysis of cell type-specific IFN-{$\beta$} reporter mice revealed that within the olfactory bulb IFN-{$\beta$} was expressed by neuroectodermal cells, primarily by astrocytes and to a lesser extent by neurons. Importantly, locally induced type I IFN triggered distal parts of the brain as indicated by the analysis of ISRE-eGFP mice which after i.n. VSV infection showed enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression throughout the brain. Compared to wild-type mice, IFN-{$\beta-$}/- mice showed increased mortality to i.n. VSV infection, whereas upon i.v. infection no such differences were detected highlighting the biological significance of intracerebrally expressed IFN-{$\beta$}. In conclusion, upon i.n. VSV instillation, IFN-{$\beta$} responses mounted by astrocytes within the olfactory bulb critically contribute to the antiviral defense by stimulating distal IFN-{$\beta$}-negative brain areas and thus arresting virus spread.
IMPORTANCE The central nervous system has long been considered an immune privileged site. More recently, it became evident that specialized immune mechanisms are active within the brain to control pathogens. Previously, we showed that virus, which entered the brain via the olfactory route, was arrested within the olfactory bulb by a type I IFN-dependent mechanism. Since peripheral type I IFN would not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and within the brain thus far no abundant type I IFN responses have been detected, here we addressed from where locally active IFN originated from. We found that upon intranasal VSV instillation, primarily astrocytes, and to a lesser extent neurons, were stimulated within the olfactory bulb to mount IFN-{$\beta$} responses that also activated and protected distal brain areas. Our results are surprising because in other infection models astrocytes have not yet been identified as major type I IFN producers.},

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-6 is a cytokine produced by several cell types including antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. IL-6 is involved in the acute phase response, B cell maturation, and macrophage differentiation. Here, we discuss a novel function of IL-6: the control of T helper (Th) 1/Th2 differentiation. IL-6 promotes Th2 differentiation and simultaneously inhibits Th1 polarization through two independent molecular mechanisms. IL-6 activates transcription mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) leading to production of IL-4 by na{\"\i}ve CD4+ T cells and their differentiation into effector Th2 cells. While the induction of Th2 differentiation by IL-6 is dependent upon endogenous IL-4, inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is IL-4- and NFAT-independent. IL-6 inhibits Th1 differentiation by upregulating supressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 expression to interfere with IFN{$\gamma$} signaling and the development of Th1 cells. Since IL-6 is abundantly produced by APC, it is a likely source of early Th1/Th2 control during CD4+ T cell activation. Thus, by using two independent molecular mechanisms, IL-6 plays a dual role in Th1/Th2 differentiation.},

  abstract = {Many adaptations have evolved in small mammals to maximize survival during winter. One such coping tactic in many species is an alteration of immune function in advance of the stressful conditions of winter. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue, and in addition to its central role in energy metabolism, leptin mediates the interactions among energy allocation, immune function, and reproduction. To examine this interaction further, exogenous leptin was administered for 2 weeks via osmotic minipumps to Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) housed in long or short days for a total of 12 weeks. Short-day hamsters displayed the expected reductions in humoral immune function, body mass, fat mass, and food intake. In Exp 1, exogenous leptin counteracted the reduction in food intake and the suppression of immune function in short days. In Exp 2, when the leptin-induced increase in food intake in short-day hamsters was prevented, leptin did not enhance immune function. In most of the measured fat pads and body mass, leptin had no effect in long days. In sum, leptin administered to short-day animals caused them to respond, in many cases, like long-day animals. Taken together, these data suggest that leptin acts indirectly to mediate energy allocation to humoral immune function. Additionally, leptin appears to act differentially, according to photoperiod, to regulate both immune and energetic parameters.},

The minimum effective dose was 0.1 \textmu g. or less. With all toxin preparations tested, the duration of the effect was directly related to the dose injected. The heat-killed cells of Esch. coli proved approximately as effective as the endotoxins prepared from Gram-negative bacilli. In contrast, heat-killed cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG) were much less active, and heat-killed cells of Staphylococcus aureus were essentially inactive. Mice previously treated with endotoxin exhibited a marked degree of tolerance to the inhibition of water intake caused in normal animals by a subsequent treatment with the same material. Tolerance could also be induced by vaccination with heat-killed Gram-negative bacilli. Tolerance overlapped from one bacterial species to another but was more pronounced toward the endotoxin prepared from the bacterial culture with which the animal was vaccinated. The duration of the inhibitory effect of endotoxin on water intake was much shorter with mice fed a complete diet than with mice fed a deficient diet (corn). It took approximately the same dose of endotoxin (0.1 \textmu g.) to inhibit water intake, reduce the influx of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and enhance staphylococcal infection.},

  abstract = {The immune and the circadian systems interact in a bidirectional fashion. The master circadian oscillator, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, responds to peripheral and local immune stimuli, such as proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial endotoxin. Astrocytes exert several immune functions in the CNS, and there is growing evidence that points toward a role of these cells in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The aim of this work was to assess the response of SCN astrocytes to immune stimuli, particularly to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-{$\alpha$}. TNF-{$\alpha$} applied to cultures of SCN astrocytes from Per2luc knockin mice altered both the phase and amplitude of PER2 expression rhythms, in a phase-dependent manner. Furthermore, conditioned media from SCN astrocyte cultures transiently challenged with TNF-{$\alpha$} induced an increase in Per1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells, which was blocked by TNF-{$\alpha$} antagonism. In addition, these conditioned media could induce phase shifts in SCN PER2 rhythms and, when administered intracerebroventricularly, induced phase delays in behavioral circadian rhythms and SCN activation in control mice, but not in TNFR-1 mutants. In summary, our results show that TNF-{$\alpha$} modulates the molecular clock of SCN astrocytes in vitro, and also that, in response to this molecule, SCN astrocytes can modulate clock gene expression in other cells and tissues, and induce phase shifts in a circadian behavioral output in vivo. These findings suggest a role for astroglial cells in the alteration of circadian timing by immune activation.},

  abstract = {In 1935, the olfactory route was hypothesized to be a portal for virus entry into the central nervous system (CNS). This hypothesis was based on experiments in which nasophayngeal infection with poliovirus in monkeys was prevented from spreading to their CNS via transection of olfactory tracts between the olfactory neuroepithelium (ONE) of the nasal cavity and the olfactory bulb (OB). Since then, numerous neurotropic viruses have been observed to enter the CNS via retrograde transport along axons of olfactory sensory neurons whose cell bodies reside in the ONE. Importantly, this route of infection can occur even after subcutaneous inoculation of arboviruses that can cause encephalitis in humans. While the olfactory route is now accepted as an important pathway for viral entry into the CNS, it is unclear whether it provides a way for infection to spread to other brain regions. More recently, studies of antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses within the olfactory bulb suggest it provides early virologic control. Here we will review the data demonstrating that neurotropic viruses gain access to the CNS initially via the olfactory route with emphasis on findings that suggest the OB is a critical immunosensory effector organ that effectively clears virus.},

In mammals the molecular clock consists of a network of proteins that form auto-regulatory feedback loops that drive rhythms in physiology and behavior. In recent times the extent to which the molecular clock controls key metabolic and immune pathways has begun to emerge. For example, the main clock protein BMAL1 has been linked to mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics and various host defense pathways. The molecular clock may function to integrate daily metabolic changes driven by feeding-fasting to immune function and output. Understanding how the clock intersects with metabolic pathways within immune cells to affect immune phenotypes will have broad implications for the management of metabolic, inflammatory and infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Microglia are the primary immune cell in the brain and are postulated to play important roles outside of immunity. Administration of the dual colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)/c-Kit kinase inhibitor, PLX3397, to adult mice results in the elimination of \textasciitilde 99\% of microglia, which remain eliminated for as long as treatment continues. Upon removal of the inhibitor, microglia rapidly repopulate the entire adult brain, stemming from a central nervous system (CNS) resident progenitor cell. Using this method of microglial elimination and repopulation, the role of microglia in both healthy and diseased states can be explored. Here, we examine the responsiveness of newly repopulated microglia to an inflammatory stimulus, as well as determine the impact of these cells on behavior, cognition, and neuroinflammation. Two month-old wild-type mice were placed on either control or PLX3397 diet for 21 d to eliminate microglia. PLX3397 diet was then removed in a subset of animals to allow microglia to repopulate and behavioral testing conducted beginning at 14 d repopulation. Finally, inflammatory profiling of the microglia-repopulated brain in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.25 mg/kg) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was determined 21 d after inhibitor removal using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as well as detailed analyses of microglial morphologies. We find mice with repopulated microglia to perform similarly to controls by measures of behavior, cognition, and motor function. Compared to control/resident microglia, repopulated microglia had larger cell bodies and less complex branching in their processes, which resolved over time after inhibitor removal. Inflammatory profiling revealed that the mRNA gene expression of repopulated microglia was similar to normal resident microglia and that these new cells appear functional and responsive to LPS. Overall, these data demonstrate that newly repopulated microglia function similarly to the original resident microglia without any apparent adverse effects in healthy adult mice.},

We and others have previously shown that effects of LPS on BBB transport are highly dependent on the injection paradigm used, and timing of the study. Cytokine expression in both brain and serum compartments influence the BBB response to an inflammatory stimulus, and mediate changes in BBB transport. Here, we used multianalyte technology to simultaneously determine the responses of 13 cytokines and chemokines (G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL- 1{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IP-10, KC, MCP-1, MIP-l{$\alpha$}, RANTES, and TNF- {$\alpha$}) in brain and blood to single and repeated injections of LPS and path analysis to determine the major relations among these analytes. Major findings are: 1) in comparison to measurements taken from a time course after a single injection of LPS, the three injection regimen of LPS produced significantly higher levels in brain for G-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and TNF and in serum for G-CSF, IL-6, and GM-CSF and 2) path analysis distinguished direct from indirect correlations between analyte pairs, with MCP-1, IL-6, G-CSF, and KC mediating relations among these cytokines both within and between serum and brain compartments. These results suggest that potentiation of cytokine levels in brain and serum compartments could play important roles in the regulation of BBB transport, and that our novel application of an established statistical method can be used to assess direct correlations within multiplexed datasets.},

A suppressed response, known as endotoxin tolerance, is associated with worse outcomes, yet endotoxin tolerance-inducing TLR4 ligands are known to protect animals from infection. Thus, it remains unknown whether the magnitude of the LPS-elicited cytokine response provides an accurate assessment of antimicrobial immunity. To address this, the ability of diverse TLR ligands to modify the LPS-elicited cytokine response and resistance to infection were assessed. Priming of mice with LPS, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), or poly(I:C) significantly reduced plasma LPS\textendash elicited proinflammatory cytokines, reflecting endotoxin tolerance, whereas CpG-ODN\textendash primed mice showed augmented cytokine production. In contrast, LPS, MPLA, and CpG-ODN, but not poly(I:C), improved the host response to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Mice primed with protective TLR ligands, including CpG-ODN, showed reduced plasma cytokines during P. aeruginosa infection. The protection imparted by TLR ligands persisted for up to 15 d yet was independent of the adaptive immune system. In bone marrow\textendash derived macrophages, protective TLR ligands induced a persistent metabolic phenotype characterized by elevated glycolysis and oxidative metabolism as well as augmented size, granularity, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst. Sustained augmentation of glycolysis in TLR-primed cells was dependent, in part, on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-{$\alpha$} and was essential for increased phagocytosis. In conclusion, the magnitude of LPS-elicited cytokine production is not indicative of antimicrobial immunity after exposure to TLR ligands. Additionally, protective TLR ligands induce sustained augmentation of phagocyte metabolism and antimicrobial function.},

  abstract = {As pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to accelerate, the French Health Minister, Olivier V\'eran, has confused matters by claiming on Twitter that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or cortisone could aggravate the infection ([ 1 ][1]). However, scientific evidence does not indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption puts patients who otherwise might have mild or asymptomatic infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome\textendash coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\textemdash the virus that causes COVID-19\textemdash at risk of more severe disease. People taking NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop doing so for fear of increasing their COVID-19 risk.

NSAIDs work by suppressing prostaglandin synthases 1 and 2, colloquially known as COX-1 and COX-2. These enzymes produce prostaglandins (PGs), lipids that can trigger pain and fever. COX-2 produces most of the PGs relevant to pain and inflammation. NSAIDs selective for inhibiting COX-2 include celecoxib and diclofenac; ibuprofen is an NSAID that blocks both COXs. Minister V\'eran advised people to take paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead to treat a fever ([ 1 ][1]), but this guidance only adds to the confusion given that acetaminophen is also an NSAID ([ 2 ][2]).

We don't know with certainty whether NSAIDs could lead to more severe COVID-19 symptoms because PGs, such as PGE2, PGD2, and prostacyclin (PGI2) can both promote and restrain inflammation. For example, the infection of certain immune cells (microglia) with a related coronavirus (not the one that causes COVID-19) activates a proinflammatory response (the inflammasome) to combat the pathogen; however, PGD2 increases the expression of PYDC3, a putative inflammasome inhibitor, in certain immune cells in mice ([ 3 ][3]). The SARS coronavirus responsible for the 2003 outbreak directly binds to the COX-2 promotor and increases its expression ([ 4 ][4]), boosting PG production capacity, and there is also evidence that PGE2 inhibits SARS coronavirus replication ([ 5 ][5]). Indomethacin, an NSAID, blocks coronavirus RNA synthesis but independently of COX inhibition ([ 6 ][6]). By contrast, COX-2\textendash dependent PGE2 attenuates the chronic antiviral lymphocyte response of unresolved viral infection ([ 7 ][7]). Based on these findings, if we see a clinical signal, we can rationalize it, but therein lies the challenge. Many clinical anecdotes remain stalled in biological plausibility.

The prospect of a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases prompts us to seek covariates of disease severity, from the consumption of certain drugs before infection, to human genetic variants ([ 8 ][8]), to demographic factors such as sex and environmental exposures. In the case of NSAIDs, commonly acquired without prescription, such determination requires documentation of drug exposure and evidence of PG suppression.

Considering all of this, should patients with clinically complicated SARS-CoV-2 infections be administered NSAIDs as a treatment? No. There is no evidence of benefit. If such a patient were also to have poor kidney function, maintenance of renal blood flow becomes critically dependent on vasodilator PGs, such as PGE2 and PGI2 ([ 9 ][9]). Such a situation might also predispose the patient to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications of NSAIDs. However, until we have robust evidence, patients in chronic pain should continue to take their NSAIDs rather than turn to opiates. Given that the elderly appear to comprise the predominant at-risk group for severe COVID-19 at this time, an association between NSAIDs and the disease may merely reflect reverse causality\textemdash that is, infection makes you more susceptible to adverse effects of NSAIDs on the infection.

A similar rationale should be applied to evidence that coronaviruses use the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 as a receptor for cellular entry ([ 10 ][10]). There has been speculation, but no clinical evidence, that consumption of ACE inhibitors might worsen the consequences of infection ([ 11 ][11]). Patients on ACE inhibitors should continue to take them rather than risk complications, such as stroke.

The use of Matlab-based tools such as the famous Wavelab and Sparselab packages in promoting reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis has been presented. In particular, the authors point to the success of the reproducible research discipline in increasing the reliability of computational research and reflect on the effort necessary for implementing this discipline in a research group and overcoming possible objections to it. An article also describes a Python interface to the well-known Clawpack package for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations that appear in wave propagation problems. The author argues strongly in favor of reproducible computations and shows an example using a simplified Python interface to Fortran code. An article also represents the field of bioinformatics, which has been a stronghold of reproducible research. It describes the cacher package, which is built on top of the R computing environment. Cacher enables a modular approach to reproducible computations by storing results of intermediate computations in a database. The special issue ends with an article on the legal aspects of reproducible research, including copyright and licensing issues.},

  abstract = {With the exception of high latitudes, life has evolved under bright days and dark nights. Most organisms have developed endogenously driven circadian rhythms that are synchronized to this daily light/dark cycle. In recent years, humans have shifted away from the naturally occurring solar light cycle in favor of artificial and sometimes irregular light schedules produced by electric lighting. Exposure to unnatural light cycles is increasingly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the means by which environmental lighting alters metabolism are poorly understood. Thus, we exposed mice to dim light at night and investigated changes in the circadian system and metabolism. Here we report that exposure to ecologically relevant levels of dim (5 lux) light at night altered core circadian clock rhythms in the hypothalamus at both the gene and protein level. Circadian rhythms in clock expression persisted during light at night; however, the amplitude of Per1 and Per2 rhythms was attenuated in the hypothalamus. Circadian oscillations were also altered in peripheral tissues critical for metabolic regulation. Exposure to dimly illuminated, as compared to dark, nights decreased the rhythmic expression in all but one of the core circadian clock genes assessed in the liver. Additionally, mice exposed to dim light at night attenuated Rev-Erb expression in the liver and adipose tissue. Changes in the circadian clock were associated with temporal alterations in feeding behavior and increased weight gain. These results are significant because they provide evidence that mild changes in environmental lighting can alter circadian and metabolic function. Detailed analysis of temporal changes induced by nighttime light exposure may provide insight into the onset and progression of obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other disorders involving sleep and circadian rhythm disruption.},

  abstract = {The mammalian circadian system regulates many physiological functions including inflammatory responses. Appropriately timed light information is essential for maintaining circadian organization. Over the past {$\sim$}120years, urbanization and the widespread adoption of electric lights have dramatically altered lighting environments. Exposure to light at night (LAN) is pervasive in modern society and disrupts core circadian clock mechanisms. Because microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain and macrophages contain intrinsic circadian clocks, we hypothesized that chronic exposure to LAN would alter microglia cytokine expression and sickness behavior following LPS administration. Exposure to 4weeks of dim LAN elevated inflammatory responses in mice. Mice exposed to dimly lit, as compared to dark, nights exaggerated changes in body temperature and elevated microglia pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following LPS administration. Furthermore, dLAN mice had a prolonged sickness response following the LPS challenge. Mice exposed to dark or dimly lit nights had comparable sickness behavior directly following the LPS injection; however, dLAN mice showed greater reductions in locomotor activity, increased anorectic behavior, and increased weight loss than mice maintained in dark nights 24h post-LPS injection. Overall, these data suggest that chronic exposure to even very low levels of light pollution may alter inflammatory responses. These results may have important implications for humans and other urban dwelling species that commonly experience nighttime light exposure.},

  abstract = {The circadian system regulates many physiological functions including inflammatory responses. For example, mortality caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection varies depending on the time of immunostimulation in mammals. The effects of more subtle challenges on the immune system and cellular mechanisms underlying circadian differences in neuroinflammatory responses are not well understood. Here we show that adult male Sprague\textendash Dawley rats injected with a sub-septic dose of LPS during the light phase displayed elevated sickness behaviors and hippocampal cytokine production compared to rats injected during the dark phase. Microglia are the primary central nervous system (CNS) immune cell type and may mediate diurnal differences in sickness response, thus we explored whether microglia demonstrate temporal variations in inflammatory factors. Hippocampal microglia isolated from adult rats rhythmically expressed inflammatory factors and circadian clock genes. Microglia displayed robust rhythms of TNF{$\alpha$}, IL1{$\beta$} and IL6 mRNA, with peak cytokine gene expression occurring during the middle of the light phase. Microglia isolated during the light phase were also more reactive to immune stimulation; such that, ex vivo LPS treatment induced an exaggerated cytokine response in light phase-isolated microglia. Treating microglia with corticosterone ex vivo induced expression of the circadian clock gene Per1. However, microglia isolated from adrenalectomized rats maintained temporal differences in clock and inflammatory gene expression. This suggests circadian clock gene expression in microglia is entrained by, but oscillates in the absence of, glucocorticoids. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that microglia possess a circadian clock that influences inflammatory responses. These results indicate time-of-day is an important factor to consider when planning inflammatory interventions such as surgeries or immunotherapies.},

Microglia \textendash the innate immune cell of the CNS \textendash{} possess endogenous timekeeping mechanisms that regulate immune responses. Here, we explored whether aging is associated with disrupted diurnal rhythms in microglia and neuroinflammatory processes. First, hippocampal microglia isolated from young rats (4 mos. F344XBN) rhythmically expressed circadian clock genes, whereas microglia isolated from the hippocampus of aged rats (25 mos.) had aberrant Per1 and Per2 rhythms. Unstimulated microglia from young rats exhibited robust rhythms of TNF{$\alpha$} and IL-1{$\beta$} mRNA expression, whereas those from aged rats had flattened and tonically-elevated cytokine expression. Similarly, microglial activation markers were diurnally regulated in the hippocampus of young but not aged rats and diurnal differences in responsiveness to both ex vivo and in vivo inflammatory challenges were abolished in aged rats. Corticosterone is an entraining signal for extra-SCN circadian rhythms. Here, corticosterone stimulation elicited similar Per1 induction in aged and young microglia. Overall, these results indicate that aging dysregulates circadian regulation of neuroinflammatory functions.},

  abstract = {Isolation of microglia from CNS tissue provides a powerful tool to study basic microglia biology and examine the effects of in vivo treatments on microglia immunophenotype and function. Previous microglia isolation methodologies utilized whole brain. However, microglia immunophenotype varies across CNS anatomical loci, thus isolation of microglia from whole brain may obscure regional brain variations in microglia immunophenotype and function. In addition, it is unknown to what extent microglia isolation procedures alter the in situ immunophenotype and function of microglia. The present report details a procedure for the rapid isolation of microglia from discrete CNS anatomical loci and addresses the issue of whether the in situ microglia immunophenotype is significantly altered by the isolation procedure. The present microglia isolation method yielded highly enriched hippocampal microglia, which were devoid of other CNS macrophage subtypes and exhibited attributes reflecting a quiescent phenotype characteristic of microglia observed in situ under non-pathological conditions. Further, isolated microglia exhibited functional responsiveness to immunogenic stimuli ex vivo. The immunophenotypic and functional attributes of isolated microglia suggest that the isolation procedure preserves the in vivo phenotype of microglia, thus providing an experimental method with minimal procedural confounds for examining in vivo treatments on microglia ex vivo.},

  abstract = {Viruses are the major causative agents of central nervous system (CNS) infection worldwide. RNA and DNA viruses trigger broad activation of glial cells including microglia and astrocytes, eliciting the release of an array of mediators that can promote innate and adaptive immune responses. Such responses can limit viral replication and dissemination leading to infection resolution. However, a defining feature of viral CNS infection is the rapid onset of severe neuroinflammation and overzealous glial responses are associated with significant neurological damage or even death. The mechanisms by which microglia and astrocytes perceive neurotropic RNA and DNA viruses are only now becoming apparent with the discovery of a variety of cell surface and cytosolic molecules that serve as sensors for viral components. In this review we discuss the role played by members of the Toll-like family of pattern recognition receptors in the inflammatory responses of glial cells to the principle causative agents of viral encephalitis. Importantly, we also describe the evidence for the involvement of a number of newly described intracellular pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I and DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors, that are thought to function as intracellular sensors of RNA and DNA viruses, respectively. Finally, we explore the possibility that cross-talk exists between these disparate viral sensors and their signaling pathways, and describe how glial cytosolic and cell surface/endosomal pattern recognition receptors could act in a cooperative manner to promote the fulminant inflammation associated with acute neurotropic viral infection.},

  abstract = {The ratio between synaptic inhibition and excitation (sI/E) is a critical factor in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disease. We recently described a stress-induced interleukin-6 dependent mechanism leading to a decrease in sI/E in the rodent temporal cortex. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a similar mechanism takes place in the prefrontal cortex, and to elaborate strategies to prevent or attenuate it. We used aseptic inflammation (single acute injections of lipopolysaccharide, LPS, 10mg/kg) as stress model, and patch-clamp recording on a prefrontal cortical slice preparation from wild-type rat and mice, as well as from transgenic mice in which the inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling sgp130Fc was produced in a brain-specific fashion (sgp130Fc mice). The anti-inflammatory reflex was activated either by vagal nerve stimulation or peripheral administration of the nicotinic {$\alpha$}7 receptor agonist PHA543613. We found that the IL-6-dependent reduction in prefrontal cortex synaptic inhibition was blocked in sgp130Fc mice, or \textendash{} in wild-type animals \textendash{} upon application sgp130Fc. Similar results were obtained by activating the ``anti-inflammatory reflex'' \textendash{} a neural circuit regulating peripheral immune response \textendash{} by stimulation of the vagal nerve or through peripheral administration of the {$\alpha$}7 nicotinic receptor agonist PHA543613. Our results indicate that the prefrontal cortex is an important potential target of IL-6 mediated trans-signaling, and suggest a potential new avenue in the treatment of a large class of hyperexcitable neuropsychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, schizophrenic psychoses, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and depression.},

  abstract = {Many animals experience marked seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions. In response, animals display adaptive alterations in physiology and behaviour, including seasonal changes in immune function. During winter, animals must reallocate finite energy stores from relatively costly, less exigent systems (e.g. reproduction and immunity) to systems critical for immediate survival (e.g. thermoregulation). Seasonal changes in immunity are probably mediated by neuroendocrine factors signalling current energetic state. One potential hormonal candidate is insulin, a metabolic hormone released in response to elevated blood glucose levels. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential role of insulin in signalling energy status to the immune system in a seasonally breeding animal, the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus). Specifically, exogenous insulin was administered to male hamsters housed in either long 'summer-like' or short 'winter-like' days. Animals were then challenged with an innocuous antigen and immune responses were measured. Insulin treatment significantly enhanced humoural immune responses in short, but not long days. In addition, insulin treatment increased food intake and decreased blood glucose levels across photoperiodic treatments. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that insulin acts as an endocrine signal integrating seasonal energetic changes and immune responses in seasonally breeding rodents.},

While the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 increases in the brain with age, its role in microglia priming is not known. This study examined the functional role of IL-6 signaling on microglia priming. Our hypothesis is that IL-6 signaling mediates primed states of microglia in the aged. An initial study assessed age-related alteration in IL-6 signaling molecules; sIL-6R and sgp130 were measured in cerebrospinal fluid of young and aged wild-type animals. Subsequent studies of isolated microglia from C57BL6/J (IL-6+/+) and IL-6 knock-out (IL-6-/-) mice showed significantly less MHC-II expression in aged IL-6-/- compared to IL-6+/+ counterparts. Additionally, adult and aged IL-6+/+ and IL-6-/- animals were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate a peripheral infection; sickness behaviors and hippocampal cytokine gene expression were measured over a 24 h period. Aged IL-6-/- animals were resilient to LPS-induced sickness behaviors and recovered more quickly than IL-6+/+ animals. The age-associated baseline increase of IL-1{$\beta$} gene expression was ablated in aged IL-6-/- mice, suggesting IL-6 is a key driver of cytokine activity from primed microglia in the aged brain. We employed in vitro studies to understand molecular mechanisms in priming factors. MHC-II and pro-inflammatory gene expression (IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-10, IL-6) were measured after treating BV.2 microglia with sIL-6R and IL-6 or IL-6 alone. sIL-6R enhanced expression of both pro-inflammatory genes and MHC-II. Taken together, these data suggest IL-6 expression throughout life is involved in microglia priming and increased amounts of IL-6 following peripheral LPS challenge are involved in exaggerated sickness behaviors in the aged.},

The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined.

Nasal administration as a means of delivering therapeutic agents preferentially to the brain has gained significant recent interest. While some substrates appear to be delivered directly to the brain via this route, the mechanisms governing overall brain uptake and exposure remain unclear. Some substrates utilize the olfactory nerve tract and gain direct access to the brain, thus bypassing the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB). However, most agents of pharmacologic interest likely gain access to the brain via the olfactory epithelium, which represents a more direct route of uptake. While the traditional BBB is not present at the interface between nasal epithelium and brain, P-glycoprotein (and potentially other barrier transporters) is expressed at this interface. In addition, work in this laboratory has demonstrated that P-glycoprotein throughout the brain can be modulated with nasal administration of appropriate inhibitors. The potential for targeted central nervous system delivery via this route is discussed. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association},

Phase response curves provide valuable information on the properties of oscillators and their synchronization. This chapter discusses biological self-sustained oscillators (circadian clock, physiological rhythms, etc.) in the context of nonlinear dynamics theory. Coupled oscillators can synchronize with different frequency ratios, can generate toroidal dynamics (superposition of independent frequencies), and may lead to deterministic chaos. These nonlinear phenomena can be analyzed with the aid of a phase transition curve, which is intimately related to the phase response curve. For illustration purposes, this chapter discusses a model of circadian oscillations based on a delayed negative feedback. In a second part, the chapter provides a step-by-step recipe to measure phase response curves. It discusses specifications of this recipe for circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, neuronal spikes, central pattern generators, and insect communication. Finally, it stresses the predictive power of measured phase response curves. PRCs can be used to quantify the coupling strength of oscillations, to classify oscillator types, and to predict the complex dynamics of periodically driven oscillations.},

Under neuro-inflammatory conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), circulating monocytes invade the CNS parenchyma where they further differentiate into macrophages or inflammatory dendritic cells. Often it is difficult to delineate resident microglia from infiltrating myeloid cells using currently known markers.

Circadian rhythm dysfunction has been associated with inflammation in the periphery, but the role of the core clock in neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Rev-erb{$\alpha$}, a nuclear receptor and circadian clock component, is a mediator of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. We observed time-of-day oscillation in microglial immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, which was disrupted in Rev-erb{$\alpha-$}/- mice. Rev-erb{$\alpha$} deletion caused spontaneous microglial activation in the hippocampus and increased expression of proinflammatory transcripts, as well as secondary astrogliosis. Transcriptomic analysis of hippocampus from Rev-erb{$\alpha-$}/- mice revealed a predominant inflammatory phenotype and suggested dysregulated NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling. Primary Rev-erb{$\alpha-$}/- microglia exhibited proinflammatory phenotypes and increased basal NF-{$\kappa$}B activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Rev-erb{$\alpha$} physically interacts with the promoter regions of several NF-{$\kappa$}B\textendash related genes in primary microglia. Loss of Rev-erb{$\alpha$} in primary astrocytes had no effect on basal activation but did potentiate the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vivo, Rev-erb{$\alpha-$}/- mice exhibited enhanced hippocampal neuroinflammatory responses to peripheral LPS injection, while pharmacologic activation of Rev-erbs with the small molecule agonist SR9009 suppressed LPS-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation. Rev-erb{$\alpha$} deletion influenced neuronal health, as conditioned media from Rev-erb{$\alpha$}\textendash deficient primary glial cultures exacerbated oxidative damage in cultured neurons. Rev-erb{$\alpha-$}/- mice also exhibited significantly altered cortical resting-state functional connectivity, similar to that observed in neurodegenerative models. Our results reveal Rev-erb{$\alpha$} as a pharmacologically accessible link between the circadian clock and neuroinflammation.},

  abstract = {REV-ERB{$\alpha$}, the NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1) gene product, is a dominant transcriptional silencer that represses the expression of genes involved in numerous physiological functions, including circadian rhythm, inflammation, and metabolism, and plays a crucial role in maintaining immune functions. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is tightly associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. However, the role of REV-ERB{$\alpha$} in neuroinflammation is largely unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how pharmacological activation of REV-ERB{$\alpha$} affected lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mouse microglia in vitro and in vivo. In BV2 cells or primary mouse cultured microglia, application of REV-ERB{$\alpha$} agonist GSK4112 or SR9011 dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) pathway. In BV2 cells, pretreatment with GSK4112 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-{$\kappa$}B alpha (I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}) kinase (I{$\kappa$}K), thus restraining the phosphorylation and degradation of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}, and blocked the nuclear translocation of p65, a NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit, thereby suppressing the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} (TNF{$\alpha$}). Moreover, REV-ERB{$\alpha$} agonist-induced inhibition on neuroinflammation protected neurons from microglial activation-induced damage, which were also demonstrated in mice with their ventral midbrain microinjected with GSK4112, and then stimulated with LPS. Our results reveal that enhanced REV-ERB{$\alpha$} activity suppresses microglial activation through the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway in the central nervous system.},

Mice received unilateral intranasal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline three times per week, and were immunohistologically analyzed at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after the first administration. LPS administration induced an inflammatory response in the OM, including the infiltration of Ly-6G-, CD11b-, Iba-1- and CD3-positive cells, the production of interleukin-1{$\beta$} by CD11b- and Iba-1-positive cells, and loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In the OB, we observed activation of microglia and astrocytes and decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in periglomerular cells, vesicular glutamate transporter 1, a presynaptic protein, in mitral and tufted projection neurons, and 5T4 in granule cells. Thus, the OM inflammation exerted a detrimental effect, not only on OSNs, but also on OB neurons, which might lead to neurodegeneration.},

We found that the cortical microglia contain an intrinsic molecular clock and exhibit a circadian expression of cathepsin S (CatS), a microglia-specific lysosomal cysteine protease in the brain. The genetic deletion of CatS causes mice to exhibit hyperlocomotor activity and removes diurnal variations in the synaptic activity and spine density of the cortical neurons, which are significantly higher during the dark (waking) phase than the light (sleeping) phase. Furthermore, incubation with recombinant CatS significantly reduced the synaptic activity of the cortical neurons. These results suggest that CatS secreted by microglia during the dark-phase decreases the spine density of the cortical neurons by modifying the perisynaptic environment, leading to downscaling of the synaptic strength during the subsequent light-phase. Disruption of CatS therefore induces hyperlocomotor activity due to failure to downscale the synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {The immune system is under control of the circadian clock. Many of the circadian rhythms observed in the immune system originate in direct interactions between components of the circadian clock and components of the immune system. The main means of circadian control over the immune system is by direct control of circadian clock proteins acting as transcription factors driving the expression or repression of immune genes. A second circadian control of immunity lies in the acetylation or methylation of histones to regulate gene transcription or inflammatory proteins. Furthermore, circadian clock proteins can engage in direct physical interactions with components of key inflammatory pathways such as members of the NF{$\kappa$}B protein family. This regulation is transcription independent and allows the immune system to also reciprocally exert control over circadian clock function. Thus, the molecular interactions between the circadian clock and the immune system are manifold. We highlight and discuss here the recent findings with respect to the molecular mechanisms that control time-of-day-dependent immunity. This review provides a structured overview focusing on the key circadian clock proteins and discusses their reciprocal interactions with the immune system.},

  abstract = {The circadian rhythm of the liver plays an important role in maintaining its metabolic homeostasis. We performed comprehensive expression analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) using TaqMan polymerase chain reaction of liver biopsy tissues to identify the miRNAs that are significantly up-regulated in advanced chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We found miR-10a regulated various liver metabolism genes and was markedly up-regulated by hepatitis C virus infection and poor nutritional conditions. The expression of miR-10a was rhythmic and down-regulated the expression of the circadian rhythm gene brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 1 (Bmal1) by directly suppressing the expression of RA receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA). Overexpression of miR-10a in hepatocytes blunted circadian rhythm of Bmal1 and inhibited the expression of lipid synthesis genes (sterol regulatory element binding protein [SREBP]1, fatty acid synthase [FASN], and SREBP2), gluconeogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha [PGC1{$\alpha$}]), protein synthesis (mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and ribosomal protein S6 kinase [S6K]) and bile acid synthesis (liver receptor homolog 1 [LRH1]). The expression of Bmal1 was significantly correlated with the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes and reduced Bmal1 was associated with increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels and progression of liver fibrosis in CHC. Thus, impaired circadian rhythm expression of Bmal1 by miR-10a disturbs metabolic adaptations, leading to liver damage, and is closely associated with the exacerbation of abnormal liver metabolism in patients with advanced CHC. In patients with hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis, liver tissue miR-10a levels were significantly associated with hepatic reserve, fibrosis markers, esophageal varix complications, and hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. Conclusion: MiRNA-10a is involved in abnormal liver metabolism in cirrhotic liver through down-regulation of the expression of the circadian rhythm gene Bmal1. Therefore, miR-10a is a possible useful biomarker for estimating the prognosis of liver cirrhosis.},

To improve our understanding of these cells, the research community needs genetic tools to identify and control them in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell-types. We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific \emph{Tmem119} gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX\#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX\#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous \emph{Tmem119} in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b\textsuperscript{+}CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 in microglia upon tamoxifen administration. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the \emph{Tmem119-EGFP} and \emph{Tmem119-CreERT2} lines, respectively.

  abstract = {The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is composed of thousands of oscillator neurons, each dependent on the cell-autonomous action of a defined set of circadian clock genes. Still, the major question remains how these individual oscillators are organized into a biological clock producing a coherent output able to time all the different daily changes in behavior and physiology. In the present review, the authors discuss the anatomical connections and neurotransmitters used by the SCN to control the daily rhythms in hormone release. The efferent SCN projections mainly target neurons in the medial hypothalamus surrounding the SCN. The activity of these preautonomic and neuroendocrine target neurons is controlled by differentially timed waves of, among others, vasopressin, GABA, and glutamate release from SCN terminals. Together, the data on the SCN control of neuroendocrine rhythms provide clear evidence not only that the SCN consists of phenotypically (i.e., according to neurotransmitter content) different subpopulations of neurons but also that subpopulations should be distinguished (within phenotypically similar groups of neurons) based on the acrophase of their (electrical) activity. Moreover, the specialization of the SCN may go as far as a single body structure, that is, the SCN seems to contain neurons that specifically target the liver, pineal, and adrenal.},

  abstract = {Circadian (daily) rhythms are present in almost all plants and animals. In mammals, a brain clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus maintains synchrony between environmental light/dark cycles and physiology and behavior. Over the past 100 y, especially with the advent of electric lighting, modern society has resulted in a round-the-clock lifestyle, in which natural connections between rest/activity cycles and environmental light/dark cycles have been degraded or even broken. Instances in which rapid changes to sleep patterns are necessary, such as transmeridian air travel, demonstrate negative effects of acute circadian disruption on physiology and behavior. However, the ramifications of chronic disruption of the circadian clock for mental and physical health are not yet fully understood. By housing mice in 20-h light/dark cycles, incongruous with their endogenous {$\sim$}24-h circadian period, we were able to model the effects of chronic circadian disruption noninvasively. Housing in these conditions results in accelerated weight gain and obesity, as well as changes in metabolic hormones. In the brain, circadian-disrupted mice exhibit a loss of dendritic length and decreased complexity of neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex, a brain region important in executive function and emotional control. Disrupted animals show decreases in cognitive flexibility and changes in emotionality consistent with the changes seen in neural architecture. How our findings translate to humans living and working in chronic circadian disruption is unknown, but we believe that this model can provide a foundation to understand how environmental disruption of circadian rhythms impacts the brain, behavior, and physiology.},

  abstract = {Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

  abstract = {Viral encephalitis is a major risk factor for the development of seizures, epilepsy, and hippocampal damage with associated cognitive impairment, markedly reducing quality of life in survivors. The mechanisms underlying seizures and hippocampal neurodegeneration developing during and after viral encephalitis are only incompletely understood, hampering the development of preventive treatments. Recent findings suggest that brain invasion of blood-born monocytes may be critically involved in both seizures and brain damage in response to encephalitis, whereas the relative role of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, in these processes is not clear. CCR2 and CX3CR1 are two chemokine receptors that regulate the responses of myeloid cells, such as monocytes and microglia, during inflammation. We used Ccr2-KO and Cx3cr1-KO mice to understand the role of these receptors in viral encephalitis-associated seizures and neurodegeneration, using the Theiler's virus model of encephalitis in C57BL/6 mice. Our results show that CCR2 as well as CX3CR1 plays a key role in the accumulation of myeloid cells in the CNS and activation of hippocampal myeloid cells upon infection. Furthermore, by using Cx3cr1-creER+/-tdTomatoSt/Wt reporter mice, we show that, with regard to CD45 and CD11b expression, some microglia become indistinguishable from monocytes during CNS infection. Interestingly, the lack of CCR2 or CX3CR1 receptors was associated with almost complete prevention of hippocampal damage but did not prevent seizure development after viral CNS infection. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that CNS inflammatory mechanism(s) other than the infiltrating myeloid cells trigger the development of seizures during viral encephalitis.},

The circadian clock has been attributed with coordinating these variations on multiple levels; however, their molecular basis is little understood. Here, we systematically investigated the link between the circadian clock and rhythmic immune functions. We show that spleen, lymph nodes, and peritoneal macrophages of mice contain intrinsic circadian clockworks that operate autonomously even ex vivo. These clocks regulate circadian rhythms in inflammatory innate immune functions: Isolated spleen cells stimulated with bacterial endotoxin at different circadian times display circadian rhythms in TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, we found that these rhythms are not driven by systemic glucocorticoid variations nor are they due to the detected circadian fluctuation in the cellular constitution of the spleen. Rather, a local circadian clock operative in splenic macrophages likely governs these oscillations as indicated by endotoxin stimulation experiments in rhythmic primary cell cultures. On the molecular level, we show that {$>$}8\% of the macrophage transcriptome oscillates in a circadian fashion, including many important regulators for pathogen recognition and cytokine secretion. As such, understanding the cross-talk between the circadian clock and the immune system provides insights into the timing mechanism of physiological and pathophysiological immune functions.},

These cells of mesodermal/mesenchymal origin migrate into all regions of the central nervous system, disseminate through the brain parenchyma, and acquire a specific ramified morphological phenotype termed ``resting microglia.'' Recent studies indicate that even in the normal brain, microglia have highly motile processes by which they scan their territorial domains. By a large number of signaling pathways they can communicate with macroglial cells and neurons and with cells of the immune system. Likewise, microglial cells express receptors classically described for brain-specific communication such as neurotransmitter receptors and those first discovered as immune cell-specific such as for cytokines. Microglial cells are considered the most susceptible sensors of brain pathology. Upon any detection of signs for brain lesions or nervous system dysfunction, microglial cells undergo a complex, multistage activation process that converts them into the ``activated microglial cell.'' This cell form has the capacity to release a large number of substances that can act detrimental or beneficial for the surrounding cells. Activated microglial cells can migrate to the site of injury, proliferate, and phagocytose cells and cellular compartments.},

We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data.

Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the RStan package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

However, some viruses enter the NS with high efficiency via the bloodstream or by directly infecting nerves that innervate peripheral tissues, resulting in debilitating direct and immune-mediated pathology. Most viruses in the NS are opportunistic or accidental pathogens, but a few, most notably the alpha herpesviruses and rabies virus, have evolved to enter the NS efficiently and exploit neuronal cell biology. Remarkably, the alpha herpesviruses can establish quiescent infections in the PNS, with rare but often fatal CNS pathology. Here we review how viruses gain access to and spread in the well-protected CNS, with particular emphasis on alpha herpesviruses, which establish and maintain persistent NS infections.},

We recently demonstrated that minute amounts of IFN applied before infection (IFN priming) can ameliorate the IFN response of tissue cells to SARS-CoV. IFN priming of SARS-CoV-infected cells activated genes for IFN transcription, IFN signaling, antiviral effector proteins, ubiquitinylation and ISGylation, antigen presentation, and other cytokines and chemokines, whereas IFN treatment or infection alone had no major effect. Thus, the IFN which is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells could enable tissue cells to at least partially overturn the SARS-CoV-induced block in innate immune activation.},

Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24-h variations found in virtually all physiological processes. These circadian rhythms are generated by circadian clocks, located in most cell types, including cells of the immune system. This review presents an overview of the clocks in the immune system and of the circadian regulation of the function of immune cells. Most immune cells express circadian clock genes and present a wide array of genes expressed with a 24-h rhythm. This has profound impacts on cellular functions, including a daily rhythm in the synthesis and release of cytokines, chemokines and cytolytic factors, the daily gating of the response occurring through pattern recognition receptors, circadian rhythms of cellular functions such as phagocytosis, migration to inflamed or infected tissue, cytolytic activity, and proliferative response to antigens. Consequently, alterations of circadian rhythms (e.g., clock gene mutation in mice or environmental disruption similar to shift work) lead to disturbed immune responses.

  abstract = {Circadian clock dysfunction is a common symptom of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, though its impact on brain health is poorly understood. Astrocyte activation occurs in response to diverse insults and plays a critical role in brain health and disease. We report that the core circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrogliosis in a synergistic manner via a cell-autonomous mechanism and a lesser non-cell-autonomous signal from neurons. Astrocyte-specific Bmal1 deletion induces astrocyte activation and inflammatory gene expression in~vitro and in~vivo, mediated in part by suppression of glutathione-S-transferase signaling. Functionally, loss of Bmal1 in astrocytes promotes neuronal death in~vitro. Our results demonstrate that the core clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrocyte activation and function in~vivo, elucidating a mechanism by which the circadian clock could influence many aspects of brain function and neurological disease.},

The specific mechanisms governing the interaction between circadian systems, aging, and the immune system are still being uncovered.

Obesity is associated with an increase in the prevalence and severity of infections. Genetic animal models of obesity (ob/ob and db/db mice) display altered centrally-mediated sickness behaviour in response to acute inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the effect of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on the anorectic and febrile response to LPS in mice is unknown. This study therefore determined how DIO and ob/ob mice respond to a systemic inflammatory challenge. C57BL/6 DIO and ob/ob mice, and their respective controls, were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS. Compared with controls, DIO and ob/ob mice exhibited an altered febrile response to LPS (100 {$\mu$}g/kg) over 8 hours. LPS caused a greater and more prolonged anorexic effect in DIO compared with control mice and, in ob/ob mice, LPS induced a reduction in food intake and body weight earlier than it did in controls. These effects of LPS in obese mice were also seen after a fixed dose of LPS (5 {$\mu$}g). LPS (100 {$\mu$}g/kg) induced Fos protein expression in several brain nuclei of control mice, with fewer Fos-positive cells observed in the brains of obese mice. An altered inflammatory response to LPS was also observed in obese mice compared with controls: changes in cytokine expression and release were detected in the plasma, spleen, liver and peritoneal macrophages in obese mice. In summary, DIO and ob/ob mice displayed an altered behavioural response and cytokine release to systemic inflammatory challenge. These findings could help explain why obese humans show increased sensitivity to infections.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) are performed several times on the mean of experimental conditions. When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by {$\alpha$} inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

We have investigated whether biologically active endotoxin appears in the general circulation after intraperitoneal administration of LPS (5 or 100 {$\mu$}g/kg) to rats and whether this is a prerequisite for activation of this HPA axis. Within 15 min, endotoxin appeared in the general circulation, whereas elevations of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone, and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations were not detected until 90 min after LPS injection. At this time, a marked interindividual variation was observed in plasma concentrations of endotoxin, ACTH, corticosterone, and IL-6. Elevated levels of plasma endotoxin were associated with elevated levels of ACTH, corticosterone, and IL-6. Intravenous administration of the LPS antagonist cationic antimicrobial protein 18 (5 mg/kg), which did not affect cytokine production in the peritoneal cavity, markedly reduced plasma ACTH, corticosterone, and IL-6 levels after 5 {$\mu$}g/kg LPS. Our results suggest that circulating endotoxin is required for the activation of the HPA axis. They also favor a role for circulating IL-6 in this response.},

Although there is evidence of a circadian variation in GFAP-IR in the hamster SCN and of the participation of glial cells in input and output mechanisms of the clock, the role of these cells within the circadian system is not clearly understood. The fact that astroglia can express and respond to cytokines suggests that they could work as mediators of immune signals to the circadian system. In the present study, we have found a daily variation of GFAP-IR in the mouse SCN, peaking during the light phase. In addition, we have identified GFAP and nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) in glial cells within the SCN and in primary cultures of the mouse SCN. Moreover, SCN glia cultures were transfected with an NF-{$\kappa$}B/luc construct whose transcriptional activity was increased with lipopolysaccharide 2 {$\mu$}g/ml, tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} 20 ng/ml, or interleukin-1{$\alpha$} 100 ng/ml, after 12 hr of stimulation.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the persistence of addiction remain largely unclear. Lepack et al. found that, with cocaine exposure, there is an intracellular accumulation of dopamine in neurons of a brain region called the ventral tegmental area (see the Perspective by Girault). Dopamine associates with chromatin to initiate a previously unknown form of epigenetic regulation called dopaminylation. This modification has an impact on ventral tegmental area function and, consequently, on dopaminergic action potentials. The result is aberrant dopamine signaling in the ventral striatum during periods of drug seeking.
Science, this issue p. 197; see also p. 134
Vulnerability to relapse during periods of attempted abstinence from cocaine use is hypothesized to result from the rewiring of brain reward circuitries, particularly ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. How cocaine exposures act on midbrain dopamine neurons to precipitate addiction-relevant changes in gene expression is unclear. We found that histone H3 glutamine 5 dopaminylation (H3Q5dop) plays a critical role in cocaine-induced transcriptional plasticity in the midbrain. Rats undergoing withdrawal from cocaine showed an accumulation of H3Q5dop in the VTA. By reducing H3Q5dop in the VTA during withdrawal, we reversed cocaine-mediated gene expression changes, attenuated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, and reduced cocaine-seeking behavior. These findings establish a neurotransmission-independent role for nuclear dopamine in relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the VTA.
Nuclear dopamine plays a role in cocaine-relapse\textendash related transcriptional plasticity in the rat ventral tegmental area.

During this ongoing education they have developed countless mechanisms to escape from the host's immune system.To illustrate the most common strategies of viral immune escape we have focused on two murine models of persistent infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)., LCMV is a fast replicating small RNA virus with a genome prone to mutations. Therefore, LCMV escapes from the immune system mainly by two strategies: `speed' and `shape change'. At the opposite extreme, MCMV is a large, complex DNA virus with a more rigid genome and thus the strategies used by LCMV are no option. However, MCMV has the coding capacity for additional genes which interfere specifically with the immune response of the host. These escape strategies have been described as `camouflage' and `sabotage'. Using these simple concepts we describe the spectrum of viral escapology, giving credit not only to the researchers who uncovered this fascinating area of immunology but also to the viruses themselves, who still have a few lessons to teach.},

Interestingly, colonic IL-10, RegIII{$\gamma$}, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and iNOS gene expression were increased in IKK{$\beta$}-deficient mice in the absence of bacterial challenge. This was associated with increased p52, which is involved with activation of NF-{$\kappa\beta$} through the alternative pathway. IKK{$\beta$}-deficient mice also had distinct differences in colonic tissue-associated and luminal microbiome that may confer protection against C. rodentium. Taken together, these data demonstrate that classical NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling can lead to enhanced enteric pathogen colonization and resulting colonic histopathology.},

Here, we report that BMAL1-deficient cells are significantly more susceptible to infection by two major respiratory viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, namely RSV and PIV3. Embryonic fibroblasts from Bmal1\textendash/\textendash{} mice produced nearly 10-fold more progeny virus than their wild type controls.

Because many immune parameters oscillate rhythmically with the time of day, the circadian clock has emerged as an important gatekeeper for reducing immunity-associated costs, which, in turn, enhances organismal fitness. This is mediated by interactions between extrinsic environmental cues and the intrinsic oscillators of immune cells, which together optimize immune responses throughout the circadian cycle. The elucidation of these clock-controlled immunomodulatory mechanisms might uncover new approaches for treating infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.},

The nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) plays a critical role in the cytokine-induced expression of these genes in cultured endothelium. We examined the relationship between NF-kappa B activation and endothelial cell adhesion molecule gene expression in vivo during the initiation of acute inflammation. Nuclear NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity was rapidly increased within lung and heart tissues of rats administered endotoxin, consistent with the translocation of NF-kappa B complexes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This NF-kappa B was composed of p50 and p65 subunits, and could bind NF-kappa B elements in the E-selectin promoter. NF-kappa B activation was maximal within 30 min and persisted for at least 3 hr after endotoxin treatment. NF-kappa B activation preceded the transcriptional activation of the P-selectin, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 genes. In the lung, increased expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1 protein was detected immunohistochemically. These molecular events were temporally associated with the sequestration of leukocytes and the development of pulmonary inflammation. NF-kappa B activation is therefore an early event in the initiation of acute inflammation in vivo. This molecular pathway may be of consequence in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory disease.},

Mice also have a differential susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide (LPS or endotoxin)-induced endotoxic shock, depending on the administration time in the 24 h light-dark (LD) cycle. We replicated these results in LD, but we did not find temporal differences in LPS-induced mortality in constant darkness (DD). Animals challenged with LPS showed only transient effects on their wheel locomotor activity rhythm without modification of circadian period and phase. Levels of several key factors involved in the pathology of sepsis and septic shock were tested in LD. We found that LPS-induced levels of interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, JE (MCP-1), and MIP1{$\alpha$} were significantly higher at zeitgeber time (ZT) 11 (time of increased mortality) than at ZT19 (ZT12 = time of lights-off in the animal quarters for the 12L:12D condition). Our results indicate that the differences found in mortality that are dependent on the time of LPS-challenge are not directly related to an endogenous circadian clock, and that some relevant immune factors in the development of sepsis are highly induced at ZT11, the time of higher LPS-induced mortality, compared to ZT19.

Cells which express gpl30 but no IL-6R and which therefore do not respond to IL-6 can be stimulated by the complex of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R (slL-6R). Here we show that on rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), the combination of IL-6 and slL-6R but not IL-6 alone induces expression of c-fos, GAP-43 and neuron-specific enolase followed by neuron-specific differentiation and formation of a neuronal network. The differentiation was dose-and time-dependent and followed the same kinetics as nerve-growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation. The responses of PC12 cells to IL-6/slL-6R and NGF were additive, suggesting independent signaling pathways. We demonstrate that activation of gpl30 generates a neuronal differentiation signal that is equivalent to and independent of trk/NGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Interestingly, the failure of IL-6 to induce differentiation of PC12 cells is not due to lack of surface expression of IL-6R as IL-6 alone triggered expression of GAP-43 mRNA and protein. We hypothesize that PC12 cells express more gp130 than IL-6R and that the extent of activated gp130 molecules determines the quality of the response.},

Additional layers of complexity that contribute to efficient clock function involve posttranslational modifications and enzymatic feedback loops. SIRT1, the founding member of the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases, was the first sirtuin to be reported to modulate circadian function. SIRT1 affects the circadian clock by its actions in the nucleus. Moreover, recent data implicate SIRT3 and SIRT6 in controlling mitochondrial and nuclear circadian functions, revealing previously unappreciated roles that extend to various subcellular domains, including fatty acid metabolism in the mitochondria. This review focuses on the roles of sirtuins in directing circadian functions in diverse organelles and speculates on the endogenous signals that may mediate the segregated roles of this family of enzymes.

The characteristics of the environment, as well as the processes that support the maintenance of life and that characterize the execution of activities of daily life generally present periodic variations, which are mostly synchronized with the light\&ndash;dark cycle determined by Earth\&rsquo;s rotation on its axis. These rhythms with 24-h periodicity, defined as circadian, influence events linked to the interaction between hosts and hosted microorganisms and can dramatically determine the outcome of this interplay. As for the various pathological conditions resulting from host\&ndash;microorganism interactions, a particularly interesting scenario concerns infections by viruses. When a viral agent enters the body, it alters the biological processes of the infected cells in order to favour its replication and to spread to various tissues. Though our knowledge concerning the mutual influence between the biological clock and viruses is still limited, recent studies start to unravel interesting aspects of the clock\&ndash;virus molecular interplay. Three different aspects of this interplay are addressed in this mini-review and include the circadian regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems, the impact of the biological clock on viral infection itself, and finally the putative perturbations that the virus may confer to the clock leading to its deregulation.},

Excitatory amino acids and glucocorticoids play a key role, along with a growing list of extra- and intracellular mediators, including endocannabinoids and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The result is a continually changing pattern of gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications and CpG methylation/hydroxy-methylation as well as activity of retrotransponsons that may alter genomic stability.

The concept of M-1/M-2 fomented from observations that macrophages from prototypical Th1 strains (C57BL/6, B10D2) are more easily activated to produce NO with either IFN-{$\gamma$} or LPS than macrophages from Th2 strains (BALB/c, DBA/2). In marked contrast, LPS stimulates Th2, but not Th1, macrophages to increase arginine metabolism to ornithine. Thus, M-1/M-2 does not simply describe activated or unactivated macrophages, but cells expressing distinct metabolic programs. Because NO inhibits cell division, while ornithine can stimulate cell division (via polyamines), these results also indicate that M-1 and M-2 responses can influence inflammatory reactions in opposite ways. Macrophage TGF-{$\beta$}1, which inhibits inducible NO synthase and stimulates arginase, appears to play an important role in regulating the balance between M-1 and M-2. M-1/M-2 phenotypes are independent of T or B lymphocytes because C57BL/6 and BALB/c NUDE or SCID macrophages also exhibit M-1/M-2. Indeed, M-1/M-2 proclivities are magnified in NUDE and SCID mice. Finally, C57BL/6 SCID macrophages cause CB6F1 lymphocytes to increase IFN-{$\gamma$} production, while BALB/c SCID macrophages increase TGF-{$\beta$} production. Together, the results indicate that M-1- or M-2-dominant macrophage responses can influence whether Th1/Th2 or other types of inflammatory responses occur.},

  abstract = {The circadian system of mammals is composed of a hierarchy of oscillators that function at the cellular, tissue, and systems levels. A common molecular mechanism underlies the cell-autonomous circadian oscillator throughout the body, yet this clock system is adapted to different functional contexts. In the central suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, a coupled population of neuronal circadian oscillators acts as a master pacemaker for the organism to drive rhythms in activity and rest, feeding, body temperature, and hormones. Coupling within the SCN network confers robustness to the SCN pacemaker, which in turn provides stability to the overall temporal architecture of the organism. Throughout the majority of the cells in the body, cell-autonomous circadian clocks are intimately enmeshed within metabolic pathways. Thus, an emerging view for the adaptive significance of circadian clocks is their fundamental role in orchestrating metabolism.},

Here, we demonstrate the LPS-induced Stat3 mRNA expression in the SCN and show also the circadian rhythm in Stat3 expression in the SCN, with high levels during the day. Moreover, we examined the effects of LPS (1mg/kg), applied either during the day or the night, on the rhythm in locomotor activity of male Wistar rats. We observed that recovery of normal locomotor activity patterns took longer when the animals were injected during the night. The clock genes Per1, Per2 and Nr1d1, and phosphorylation of kinases ERK1/2 and GSK3{$\beta$} are sensitive to external cues and function as the molecular entry for external signals into the circadian clockwork.

Given the proximity of the olfactory bulb to the upper airways, it is surprising that viruses that infect the upper airways, including influenza, rarely infect the brain. In mice, intranasal infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) does result in infection of sensory neurons in the olfactory bulb. Using VSV that expresses a fluorescent reporter, Moseman et al. examined the ability of VSV to infect distinct cell types within olfactory bulb. Although VSV infection was restricted to neurons within the olfactory bulb, they found that microglial cells that were not infected by VSV to be the key in priming T cell responses that promoted viral clearance.
The neuroepithelium is a nasal barrier surface populated by olfactory sensory neurons that detect odorants in the airway and convey this information directly to the brain via axon fibers. This barrier surface is especially vulnerable to infection, yet respiratory infections rarely cause fatal encephalitis, suggesting a highly evolved immunological defense. Here, using a mouse model, we sought to understand the mechanism by which innate and adaptive immune cells thwart neuroinvasion by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a potentially lethal virus that uses olfactory sensory neurons to enter the brain after nasal infection. Fate-mapping studies demonstrated that infected central nervous system (CNS) neurons were cleared noncytolytically, yet specific deletion of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) from these neurons unexpectedly had no effect on viral control. Intravital imaging studies of calcium signaling in virus-specific CD8+ T cells revealed instead that brain-resident microglia were the relevant source of viral peptide\textendash MHC I complexes. Microglia were not infected by the virus but were found to cross-present antigen after acquisition from adjacent neurons. Microglia depletion interfered with T cell calcium signaling and antiviral control in the brain after nasal infection. Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia provide a front-line defense against a neuroinvasive nasal infection by cross-presenting antigen to antiviral T cells that noncytolytically cleanse neurons. Disruptions in this innate defense likely render the brain susceptible to neurotropic viruses like VSV that attempt to enter the CNS via the nose.
Microglia protect the brain from an intranasal VSV infection by cross-presenting neuronal antigen to antiviral CD8+ T cells.

In this study, the effects of stress, GCs, and NMDA receptors on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-{$\kappa$}B in the brain were investigated. One day after chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), nonstressed and CUS rats were treated with saline or LPS and killed 2 h later.

This stress effect was blocked by pretreatment of rats with RU-486, an antagonist of the GC receptor. MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate], an NMDA receptor antagonist, also reduced the effect of LPS in all three brain regions. However, the combined antagonism of both GC and NMDA receptors produced no further reduction in NF-{$\kappa$}B activation when compared with the effect of each treatment alone.

The master clock oscillator Bmal1 modulates interleukin-6 upregulation in microglial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide. Bmal1 can play a role in microglial inflammatory responses. We previously demonstrated that gliotransmitter ATP induces transient expression of the clock gene Period1 via P2X7 purinergic receptors in cultured microglia. In this study, we further investigated mechanisms underlying the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by clock molecules in microglial cells. Several clock gene transcripts exhibited oscillatory diurnal rhythmicity in microglial BV-2 cells. Real-time luciferase monitoring also showed diurnal oscillatory luciferase activity in cultured microglia from Per1::Luciferase transgenic mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) strongly induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells, whereas an siRNA targeting Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1), a core positive component of the microglial molecular clock, selectively inhibited LPS-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. In addition, LPS-induced IL-6 expression was attenuated in microglia from Bmal1-deficient mice. This phenotype was recapitulated by pharmacological disruption of oscillatory diurnal rhythmicity using the synthetic Rev-Erb agonist SR9011. Promoter analysis of the Il6 gene revealed that Bmal1 is required for LPS-induced IL-6 expression in microglia. Mice conditionally Bmal1 deficient in cells expressing CD11b, including microglia, exhibited less potent upregulation of Il6 expression following middle cerebral artery occlusion compared with that in control mice, with a significant attenuation of neuronal damage.

  abstract = {Viral infections of central nervous system (CNS) often trigger inflammatory responses that give rise to a wide range of pathological outcomes. The CNS is equipped with an elaborate network of innate immune sentinels (e.g. microglia, macrophages, dendritic cells) that routinely serve as first responders to these infections. The mechanisms that underlie the dynamic programming of these cells following CNS viral infection remain undefined. To gain insights into this programming, we utilized a combination of genomic and two-photon imaging approaches to study a pure innate immune response to a noncytopathic virus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) as it established persistence in the brain. This enabled us to evaluate how global gene expression patterns were translated into myeloid cell dynamics following infection. Two-photon imaging studies revealed that innate myeloid cells mounted a vigorous early response to viral infection characterized by enhanced vascular patrolling and a complete morphological transformation. Interestingly, innate immune activity subsided over time and returned to a quasi-normal state as the virus established widespread persistence in the brain. At the genomic level, early myeloid cell dynamics were associated with massive changes in CNS gene expression, most of which declined over time and were linked to type I interferon signaling (IFN-I). Surprisingly, in the absence of IFN-I signaling, almost no differential gene expression was observed in the nervous system despite increased viral loads. In addition, two-photon imaging studies revealed that IFN-I receptor deficient myeloid cells were unresponsive to viral infection and remained in a na\"ive state. These data demonstrate that IFN-I engages non-redundant programming responsible for nearly all innate immune activity in the brain following a noncytopathic viral infection. This Achilles' heel could explain why so many neurotropic viruses have acquired strategies to suppress IFN-I., The central nervous system is equipped with innate immune cells that serve as first responders to sterile injuries and infections. The mechanisms that program the movement and morphological transformations of these cells following infection remain undefined. Here, we utilized a combination of genomic and in vivo imaging approaches to define pathways that program the motion of innate immune cells responding to a noncytopathic virus as it established persistence in the brain. In vivo imaging studies performed in the living brain revealed that innate myeloid cells mounted a vigorous early response that returned to a ``na\"ive'' state during persistence. This was associated at the genomic level with robust changes in gene expression that were mostly quenched over time. Analysis of the gene expression pattern revealed a prominent type I interferon (IFN-I) signature only at the early stage of infection. Surprisingly, in the absence of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, almost no genes were differentially expressed in the virally infected nervous system and all innate myeloid cells were unresponsive. These data indicate IFN-I programs all innate myeloid activity in the nervous system following a noncytopathic viral infection. This non-redundant anti-viral program represents an Achilles' heel that can be exploited by neurotropic viruses.},

  abstract = {Winter is energetically demanding. Physiological and behavioral adaptations have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with winter because thermoregulatory demands increase when food availability decreases. Seasonal breeding is central within the suite of winter adaptations among small animals. Presumably, reproductive inhibition during winter conserves energy at a time when the adds of producing viable young are low. In addition to the well-studied seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many populations of mammals and birds in the field. Challenging winter conditions, such as low ambient temperatures and decreased food availability, can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation or shock. In some cases, survival in demanding winter conditions puts individuals under great physiological stress, defined here as an adaptive process that results in elevated blood levels of glucocorticoids. The stress of coping with energetically demanding conditions can also indirectly cause illness and death by compromising immune function. Presumably, the increased blood concentrations of adrenocortical steroids in response to winter stressors compromise immune function and accelerate catabolic mechanisms in the field, although the physiological effects of elevated glucocorticoids induced by artificial stressors have been investigated primarily in the laboratory. However, recurrent environmental stressors could reduce survival if they evoke persistent glucocorticoid secretion. The working hypothesis of this article is that mechanisms have evolved in some animals to combat seasonal stress-induced immunocompromise as a temporal adaptation to promote survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals to anticipate periods of immunologically challenging conditions, and to cope with these seasonal health-threatening conditions. The primary environmental cue that permits physiological anticipation of season is the daily photoperiod; however, other environmental factors may interact with photoperiod to affect immune function and disease processes. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic organ size, structure, immune function, and disease processes, and their possible interactions with recurrent environmental stressors, is reviewed. Seasonal peaks of lymphatic organ size and structure generally occur in late autumn or early winter and seasonal minima are observed prior to the onset of breeding. Although many of the field data suggest that immune function and disease processes are also enhanced during the winter, the opposite seasonal pattern is also observed in some studies. We propose that compromised immune function may be observed in some populations during particularly harsh winters when stressors override the enhancement of immune function evoked by short day lengths. Because so many factors covary in field studies, assessment of our proposal that photoperiod mediates seasonal changes in immune function requires laboratory studies in which only photoperiod is varied. A review of the effects of photoperiod on immune function in laboratory studies reveals that exposure to short day lengths enhances immune function in every species examined. Short day exposure in small mammals causes reproductive inhibition and concomitant reduction in plasma levels of prolactin and steroid hormones, as well as alterations in the temporal pattern of pineal melatonin secretion. These hormones affect immune function, and influence the development of opportunistic diseases, including cancer: however, it appears that either prolactin or melatonin secretion is responsible for mediating the effects of photoperiod on immune function. Taken together, day length appears to affect immune function in many species, including animals that typically do not exhibit reproductive responsiveness to day length.},

  abstract = {Diurnal Immunology
Like most organ systems in the body, several components of the immune system appear to be regulated in a diurnal manner. However, the cell populations affected, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling these processes, and the functional consequences of such regulation are poorly understood. Now, Nguyen et al. (p. 1483, published online 22 August; see the Perspective by Druzd and Scheiermann) have found that trafficking of monocytes to sites of inflammation is regulated in a diurnal manner in mice. Mice harboring a myeloid cell-specific deletion in the clock protein, BMAL1, showed reduced fitness in response to both acute and chronic inflammation.
Circadian clocks have evolved to regulate physiologic and behavioral rhythms in anticipation of changes in the environment. Although the molecular clock is present in innate immune cells, its role in monocyte homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we report that Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes exhibit diurnal variation, which controls their trafficking to sites of inflammation. This cyclic pattern of trafficking confers protection against Listeria monocytogenes and is regulated by the repressive activity of the circadian gene Bmal1. Accordingly, myeloid cell-specific deletion of Bmal1 induces expression of monocyte-attracting chemokines and disrupts rhythmic cycling of Ly6Chi monocytes, predisposing mice to development of pathologies associated with acute and chronic inflammation.

The daily light\textendash dark cycle also entrains circadian rhythms in immunity. Most published reports on immunological seasonality rely on measurements or interventions performed only at one point in the day. Because there can be no perfect matching of circadian phase across photoperiods of different duration, the manner in which these timescales interact to affect immunity is not understood. We examined whether photoperiodic changes in immune function reflect phenotypic changes that persist throughout the daily cycle, or merely reflect photoperiodic shifts in the circadian phase alignment of immunological rhythms. Diurnal rhythms in blood leukocyte trafficking, infection induced sickness responses, and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin inflammatory responses were examined at high-frequency sampling intervals (every 3 h) in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) following immunological adaptation to summer or winter photoperiods. Photoperiod profoundly enhanced or suppressed immune function, in a trait-specific manner, and we were unable to identify a phase alignment of diurnal waveforms which eliminated these enhancing and suppressing effects of photoperiod. These results support the hypothesis that seasonal timescales affect immunity via mechanisms independent of circadian entrainment of the immunological circadian waveform.},

Toxin-induced silencing of Kiss1ARH neurons shifts wakefulness and food consumption to the light phase and induces weight gain. Toxin-silenced mice are less physically active and have attenuated temperature rhythms. Because the rhythm of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) appears to be intact, we hypothesize that Kiss1ARH neurons signal to neurons downstream of the master clock to modulate the output of the SCN. We conclude that, in addition to their well-established role in regulating fertility, Kiss1ARH neurons are a critical component of the hypothalamic circadian oscillator network that times overt rhythms of physiology and behavior.},

  abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Minute amounts of LPS released from infecting pathogens can initiate potent innate immune responses that prime the immune system against further infection. However, when the LPS response is not properly controlled it can lead to fatal septic shock syndrome. The common structural pattern of LPS in diverse bacterial species is recognized by a cascade of LPS receptors and accessory proteins, LPS binding protein (LBP), CD14 and the Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4)\textendash MD-2 complex. The structures of these proteins account for how our immune system differentiates LPS molecules from structurally similar host molecules. They also provide insights useful for discovery of anti-sepsis drugs. In this review, we summarize these structures and describe the structural basis of LPS recognition by LPS receptors and accessory proteins. The three-dimensional structure of molecules critical to innate immunity might inform the design of drugs that promote antipathogen defenses, while preventing inappropriate inflammatory responses that potentially lead to septic shock. A review by Beom Seok Park from Eulji University and Jie-Oh Lee from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology outlines current structural understanding of how the toll-like receptor (TLR)-containing TLR4-MD-2 complex initiates part of the innate immune response by recognizing bacterial lipopolysaccaride. Several TLR proteins each recognize other pathogen-derived ligands. The structures of six such human TLRs complexed with their ligands, and the structure of the TLR4-MD-2 complex bound to an antagonist, are helping to explain in very specific molecular detail how the recognition of pathogen-derived molecules triggers inflammation, and thus how drugs might control that process.},

In a transgenic mouse model of measles virus (MV) infection of neurons, we have previously shown that the host T-cell response was required for resolution of infection in susceptible adult mice. In this report, we show that this protective response did not result in neuronal death, even during the peak of T-cell infiltration into the brain parenchyma. When susceptible mice were intercrossed with specific immune knockout mice, a critical role for gamma interferon (IFN-{$\gamma$}) was identified in protection against MV infection and CNS disease. Moreover, the addition of previously activated splenocytes or recombinant murine IFN-{$\gamma$} to MV-infected primary neurons resulted in the inhibition of viral replication in the absence of neuronal death. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the host immune response can promote viral clearance without concomitant neuronal loss, a process that appears to be mediated by cytokines.},

  abstract = {Metabolism and inflammation are linked at many levels. Sickness behaviors are elicited by the immune system's response to antigenic stimuli, and include changes in feeding and metabolism. The immune system is also regulated by the circadian (daily) clock, which generates endogenous rhythms, and synchronizes these rhythms to the light-dark cycle. Modern society has resulted in chronic misalignment or desynchronization of the circadian clock and the external environment. We have demonstrated that circadian desynchronization (CD) in mice alters metabolic function, and also affects both peripheral and central immune responses following a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. However, it is unclear how this altered immune response impacts sickness behaviors and metabolism following challenge. To test this, we housed male mice in circadian desynchronized (10-hours light:10-hours dark) or control (12-hours light:12-hours dark) conditions for 5\textendash 6~weeks. We then challenged mice with LPS (i.p., 0.4 mg/kg) or PBS and measured changes in body mass, feeding, drinking and locomotion using a comprehensive phenotyping system. Plasma, liver, and brain were collected 36~h post-inoculation (hpi) and inflammatory messengers were measured via multiplex cytokine/chemokine array and qPCR. We find that recovery of locomotion and body mass is prolonged in CD mice following LPS challenge. Additionally, at 36 hpi the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines differ depending on pre-inoculation lighting conditions. Our findings add to the growing literature which documents how desynchronization of circadian rhythms can lead to disrupted immune responses and changes in metabolic function.},

We argue that it is essential to consider parenting within a conceptual framework that recognizes the dynamics of the reciprocal mother\textendash young relationship, including both the complexity and neuroplasticity of its underlying mechanisms. Converging research suggests that the concerted activity of a distributed network of subcortical and cortical brain structures regulates different key aspects of parenting, including the sensory analysis of infant stimuli as well as motivational, affective and cognitive processes. The interplay among these processes depends on the action of various neurotransmitters and hormones that modulate the timely and coordinated execution of caregiving responses of the maternal circuitry exquisitely attuned to the young's affect, needs and developmental stage. We conclude with a summary and a set of questions that may guide future research.},

In vitro studies showed that almost all nucleated cells are able to produce IFN-{$\beta$} to various extents, but information about the in vivo source of IFN-{$\beta$} remains incomplete. Since prominent IFN producer cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells are usually absent from the brain parenchyma, other cell types must be responsible for the synthesis of IFN after virus infection of this organ. By applying immunohistochemistry and employing conditional reporter mice that express firefly luciferase under control of the IFN-{$\beta$} promoter in either all or only distinct cell types, we found that astrocytes are the main producers of IFN-{$\beta$} after infection of the brain with diverse neurotropic viruses, including rabies virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. This finding was surprising given the fact that neurons are the principal targets of all these viruses. Analysis of a panel of knockout mouse strains revealed that sensing of viral components via both RIG-I-like helicases and Toll-like receptors contributes to IFN induction in the virus-infected brain. When using an in vivo approach to permanently mark infected cells, we observed that a substantial number of astrocytes must have transiently encountered virus during early stages of the infection. Thus, our data strongly indicate that abortive viral infection of astrocytes triggers pattern-recognition receptor signalling, which results in secretion of IFN-{$\beta$}.},

Modern industrialized society has led to a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between our endogenous timekeeping systems and the solar day, disrupting normal circadian rhythms. We have argued that disrupted circadian rhythms could lead to changes in allostatic load, and the capacity of organisms to respond to other environmental challenges. In this set of studies, we apply a model of circadian disruption characterized in our lab in which mice are housed in a 20h long day, with 10h of light and 10h of darkness. We explored the effects of this environmental disruption on sleep patterns, to establish if this model results in marked sleep deprivation. Given the interaction between circadian, sleep, and immune systems, we further probed if our model of circadian disruption also alters the innate immune response to peripheral bacterial endotoxin challenge. Our results demonstrate that this model of circadian disruption does not lead to marked sleep deprivation, but instead affects the timing and quality of sleep. We also show that while circadian disruption does not lead to basal changes in the immune markers we explored, the immune response is affected, both in the brain and the periphery. Together, our findings further strengthen the important role of the circadian timing system in sleep regulation and immune responses, and provide evidence that disrupting the circadian clock increases vulnerability to further environmental stressors, including immunological challenges.},

  abstract = {The circadian system plays an important role in regulating nearly every process in the body, keeping them in sync with each other, as well as the outside environment. However, artificial lighting and an ``always on'' society have led to the breakdown between the circadian system and the solar day. One of the most perceptible outputs of the circadian clock, particularly when it is not working properly, is the timing of the sleep-wake cycle. However, circadian rhythms are found in nearly every physiological system. Thus, it is no surprise that circadian and sleep disruption is associated with negative health outcomes, including metabolic dysregulation and obesity. Therefore, understanding how circadian disruption (CD) alters regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and metabolic function is imperative.
We induced environmental CD by housing adult male mice in an altered light-dark (LD) cycle with a period of 20h (10hr light, 10hr dark). We used a number of recording techniques to probe metabolic, circadian, and sleep function in normal lighting conditions (LD12:12, 12hr light, 12hr dark) compared to environmental CD (LD10:10). Our model of CD induces a number of changes in both metabolic function and sleep. We find a marked increase in adiposity and decreased glucose tolerance following CD. Diurnal variation in feeding and respiratory quotient are diminished during CD. In addition, there are significant changes in sleep timing and quality.
Our work also probed how disrupting the circadian clock alters the ability of an organism to respond to additional stressors. To do this, we applied an immune challenge to circadian disrupted mice, and found that the immune response to lipopolysaccharide challenge was greatly perturbed in CD mice. Conversely, we explored how genetic predisposition to being ``stress sensitive'' may change the response to CD. To accomplish this, we used a humanized mouse model carrying a val66met polymorphism (Val = normal, and Met = mutant) in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, which causes a stress-sensitive phenotype. Val mice show a loss in niche appropriate sleep timing and flattening of delta power in CD (as expected), whereas Met mice maintain both. Contrary to our initial hypothesis of increased vulnerability to CD in mice that are ``stress sensitive'', these data suggest the Met mutation may protect against the effects of CD. Together, the following chapters will explore how circadian disruption affects sleep, metabolic, and immune function (Chapters 2 and 3), and further, the role of BDNF in modulating the effects of circadian disruption (Chapter 4).},

  abstract = {Integrins are components of cell-matrix adhesions, and function as scaffolds for various signal transduction pathways. So far no lipid ligand for integrin has been reported. Here we show that a lipid, oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), directly binds to {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}3 integrins to activate integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Treatment of macrophages and epithelial cells with 25HC results in an increase in activated {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}3 integrin in podosome and focal adhesion matrix adhesion sites. Moreover, activation of pattern recognition receptor on macrophages induces secretion of 25HC, triggering integrin signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Thus, the lipid molecule 25HC is a physiologically relevant activator of integrins and is involved in positively regulating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that extracellular 25HC links innate immune inflammatory response with integrin signaling.},

  abstract = {Serious permanent neurological or psychiatric dysfunction may result from virus infections in the central nervous system (CNS). Olfactory sensory neurons are in direct contact with the external environment, making them susceptible to infection by viruses that can enter the brain via the olfactory nerve. The rarity of full brain viral infections raises the important question of whether unique immune defense mechanisms protect the brain. Here we show that both RNA (vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]) and DNA (cytomegalovirus [CMV]) virus inoculations of the nasal mucosa leading to olfactory bulb (OB) infection activate long-distance signaling that upregulates antiviral interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in uninfected remote regions of the brain. This signaling mechanism is dependent on IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} receptors deep within the brain, leading to the activation of a distant antiviral state that prevents infection of the caudal brain. In normal mice, VSV replication is limited to the OB, and these animals typically survive the infection. In contrast, mice lacking the IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} receptor succumbed to the infection, with VSV spreading throughout the brain. Chemical destruction of the olfactory sensory neurons blocked both virus trafficking into the OB and the IFN response in the caudal brain, indicating a direct signaling within the brain after intranasal infection. Most signaling within the brain occurs across the 20-nm synaptic cleft. The unique long-distance IFN signaling described here occurs across many millimeters within the brain and is critical for survival and normal brain function.
IMPORTANCE The olfactory mucosa can serve as a conduit for a number of viruses to enter the brain. Yet infections in the CNS rarely occur. The mechanism responsible for protecting the brain from viruses that successfully invade the OB, the first site of infection subsequent to infection of the nasal mucosa, remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the protection is mediated by a long-distance interferon signaling, particularly IFN-{$\beta$} released by infected neurons in the OB. Strikingly, in the absence of neurotropic virus infection, ISGs are induced in the posterior regions of the brain, activating an antiviral state and preventing further virus invasion.},

  abstract = {Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based chimeric viruses that include genes from other viruses show promise as vaccines and oncolytic viruses. However, the critical safety concern is the neurotropic nature conveyed by the VSV glycoprotein. VSVs that include the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene, even in most recombinant attenuated strains, can still show substantial adverse or lethal actions in the brain. Here, we test 4 chimeric viruses in the brain, including those in which glycoprotein genes from Nipah, chikungunya (CHIKV), and influenza H5N1 viruses were substituted for the VSV glycoprotein gene. We also test a virus-like vesicle (VLV) in which the VSV glycoprotein gene is expressed from a replicon encoding the nonstructural proteins of Semliki Forest virus. VSV{$\Delta$}G-CHIKV, VSV{$\Delta$}G-H5N1, and VLV were all safe in the adult mouse brain, as were VSV{$\Delta$}G viruses expressing either the Nipah F or G glycoprotein. In contrast, a complementing pair of VSV{$\Delta$}G viruses expressing Nipah G and F glycoproteins were lethal within the brain within a surprisingly short time frame of 2 days. Intranasal inoculation in postnatal day 14 mice with VSV{$\Delta$}G-CHIKV or VLV evoked no adverse response, whereas VSV{$\Delta$}G-H5N1 by this route was lethal in most mice. A key immune mechanism underlying the safety of VSV{$\Delta$}G-CHIKV, VSV{$\Delta$}G-H5N1, and VLV in the adult brain was the type I interferon response; all three viruses were lethal in the brains of adult mice lacking the interferon receptor, suggesting that the viruses can infect and replicate and spread in brain cells if not blocked by interferon-stimulated genes within the brain.
IMPORTANCE Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) shows considerable promise both as a vaccine vector and as an oncolytic virus. The greatest limitation of VSV is that it is highly neurotropic and can be lethal within the brain. The neurotropism can be mostly attributed to the VSV G glycoprotein. Here, we test 4 chimeric viruses of VSV with glycoprotein genes from Nipah, chikungunya, and influenza viruses and nonstructural genes from Semliki Forest virus. Two of the four, VSV{$\Delta$}G-CHIKV and VLV, show substantially attenuated neurotropism and were safe in the healthy adult mouse brain. VSV{$\Delta$}G-H5N1 was safe in the adult brain but lethal in the younger brain. VSV{$\Delta$}G Nipah F+G was even more neurotropic than wild-type VSV, evoking a rapid lethal response in the adult brain. These results suggest that while chimeric VSVs show promise, each must be tested with both intranasal and intracranial administration to ensure the absence of lethal neurotropism.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is implicated in the progressive nature of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. A single systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF{$\alpha$}, 0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) injection was administered in adult wild-type mice and in mice lacking TNF{$\alpha$} receptors (TNF R1/R2-/-) to discern the mechanisms of inflammation transfer from the periphery to the brain and the neurodegenerative consequences. Systemic LPS administration resulted in rapid brain TNF{$\alpha$} increase that remained elevated for 10 months, while peripheral TNF{$\alpha$} (serum and liver) had subsided by 9 h (serum) and 1 week (liver). Systemic TNF{$\alpha$} and LPS administration activated microglia and increased expression of brain pro-inflammatory factors (i.e., TNF{$\alpha$}, MCP-1, IL-1{$\beta$}, and NF-{$\kappa$}B p65) in wild-type mice, but not in TNF R1/R2-/- mice. Further, LPS reduced the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) by 23\% at 7-months post-treatment, which progressed to 47\% at 10 months. Together, these data demonstrate that through TNF{$\alpha$}, peripheral inflammation in adult animals can: (1) activate brain microglia to produce chronically elevated pro-inflammatory factors; (2) induce delayed and progressive loss of DA neurons in the SN. These findings provide valuable insight into the potential pathogenesis and self-propelling nature of Parkinson's disease. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background Sex plays a key role in an individual's immune response against pathogenic challenges such that females fare better when infected with certain pathogens. It is thought that sex hormones impact gene expression in immune cells and lead to sexually dimorphic responses to pathogens. We predicted that, in the presence of E. coli gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS), there would be a sexually dimorphic response in proinflammatory cytokine production and acute phase stress gene expression and that these responses might vary among different mouse strains and times in a pattern opposite to that of body temperature associated with LPS-induced shock. Materials and Methods Interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage inflammatory protein-I{$\beta$} (MIP-1{$\beta$}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) as well as beta-fibrinogen (Fgb) and metallothionein-1 (Mt-1) mRNA expression were measured at four time points (0, 2, 4 and 7 hours) after injection of E. coli LPS in mice from three inbred strains. Results Statistical analysis using analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed that the levels of the all six traits changed over time, generally peaking at 2 hours after LPS injection. Mt-1, Fgb, and IL-6 showed differences among strains, although these were time-specific. Sexual dimorphism was seen for Fgb and IL6, and was most pronounced at the latest time period (7 hours) where male levels exceeded those for females. Trends for all six cytokine/gene expression traits were negatively correlated with those for body temperatures. Discussion The higher levels of expression of Fgb and IL6 in males compared with females are consistent with the greater vulnerability of males to infection and subsequent inflammation. Temperature appears to be a useful proxy for mortality in endotoxic shock, but sexual dimorphism in cytokine and stress gene expression levels may persist after an LPS challenge even if temperatures in the two sexes are similar and have begun to stabilize.},

Neuroinflammatory responses may be helpful or harmful, as mechanisms associated with neuroinflammation are involved in normal brain development, as well as in neuropathological processes. This review examines the roles of various cell types that contribute to the immune dysregulation associated with neuroinflammation. Microglia enter the CNS very early in embryonic development and, as such, play an essential role in both the healthy and diseased brain. B-cell diversity contributes to CNS disease through both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent mechanisms. The influences of these B-cell mechanisms on other cell types, including myeloid cells and T cells, are reviewed in relationship to antibody-mediated CNS disorders, paraneoplastic neurological diseases, and multiple sclerosis.

When VSV is applied to the nasal neuroepithelium, it initially replicates in olfactory receptor neurons, and is transmitted along the olfactory nerve to the central nervous system (CNS) within 12 hours. In the olfactory bulb, the virus replicates invasively through the layers of the olfactory bulb, reaching the olfactory ventricle by day 4-5 post infection, and the hindbrain by day 8 post infection. In mice, infection may result in a 50\% mortality rate. The crucial host innate and specific immune responses responsible for restricting vital propagation and caudal spread of the virus will be discussed. The efficacy of interleukin-12 (IL-12) treatment for enhanced vital clearance and promotion of host recovery are described along with the implications for treatment of human encephalitis. The hosts' response to infection is also regulated by the sex of the host, and the age at infection. The role of specific mucosal humoral immunity and systemic cellular immunity in prevention of infection are described.},

Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a dendrite into the nasal cavity on the apical side, and on the basal side extends its axon through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain. Viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the CNS include influenza A virus, herpesviruses, poliovirus, paramyxoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, La Crosse virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and bunyaviruses. However, mechanisms of transport via the olfactory nerve and subsequent spread through the CNS are poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms are either infection of olfactory receptor neurons themselves or diffusion through channels formed by olfactory ensheathing cells. Subsequent virus spread through the CNS could occur by multiple mechanisms, including trans-synaptic transport and microfusion. Viral infection of the CNS can lead to damage from infection of nerve cells per se, from the immune response, or from a combination of both. Clinical consequences range from nervous dysfunction in the absence of histopathological changes to severe meningoencephalitis and neurodegenerative disease.

  abstract = {Most published studies of thermoregulatory responses of mice to LPS involved a stressful injection of LPS, were run at a poorly controlled and often subneutral ambient temperature (Ta), and paid little attention to the dependence of the response on the LPS dose. These pitfalls have been overcome in the present study. Male C57BL/6 mice implanted with jugular vein catheters were kept in an environmental chamber at a tightly controlled Ta. The relationship between the Tas used and the thermoneutral zone of the mice was verified by measuring tail skin temperature, either by infrared thermography or thermocouple thermometry. Escherichia coli LPS in a wide dose range (100-104 {$\mu$}g/kg) was administered through an extension of the jugular catheter from outside the chamber. The responses observed were dose dependent. At a neutral Ta, low (just suprathreshold) doses of LPS (100-101 {$\mu$}g/kg) caused a monophasic fever. To a slightly higher dose (101.5 {$\mu$}g/kg), the mice responded with a biphasic fever. To even higher doses (101.75-104 {$\mu$}g/kg), they responded with a polyphasic fever, of which three distinct phases were identified. The dose dependence and dynamics of LPS fever in the mouse appeared to be remarkably similar to those seen in the rat. However, the thermoregulatory response of mice to LPS in a subthermoneutral environment is remarkably different from that of rats. Although very high doses of LPS (104 {$\mu$}g/kg) did cause a late (latency, {$\sim$}3 h) hypothermic response in mice, the typical early (latency, 10\textendash 30 min) hypothermic response seen in rats did not occur. The present investigation identifies experimental conditions to study LPS-induced mono-, bi-, and polyphasic fevers and late hypothermia in mice and provides detailed characteristics of these responses.},

This method is particularly suited to detect periodic components in unequally sampled time-series and data sets with missing values, but restricts all calculations to actually measured values. The Lomb-Scargle method was tested on both real and simulated time-series with even and uneven sampling, and compared to a standard method in biomedical rhythm research, the Chi-square periodogram. Results indicate that the Lomb\textendash Scargle algorithm shows a clearly better detection efficiency and accuracy in the presence of noise, and avoids possible bias or erroneous results that may arise from replacement of missing data by interpolation techniques. Hence, the Lomb\textendash Scargle periodogram may serve as a useful method for the study of biological rhythms, especially when applied to telemetrical or observational time-series obtained from free-living animals, i.e., data sets that notoriously lack points.},

In turn, IL-10 is induced by LPS and acts as a negative feedback to limit TNF production. We investigated the effects of IL-10 on brain TNF and IL-1{$\beta$} production induced by a central LPS administration in mice. Because central LPS also induces peripheral TNF, we also measured the serum TNF levels. A single intracere-broventricular injection of murine recombinant IL-10 (75 ng/mouse) simultaneously with LPS (2.5 \textmu g/mouse) almost completely inhibited brain TNF production. The brain IL-1{$\beta$} production was also inhibited, as was the serum concentration of the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular administration of an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody (JES5-2A5; 60 \textmu g/mouse) potentiated brain TNF and IL-1{$\beta$} production. Identical results were obtained when the serum TNF levels were measured. IL-10 did not affect the LPS-induced increase of serum corticosterone, the main endogenous inhibitor of TNF production, or the induction of IL-6. These results indicate that LPS-induced IL-10 can act as an important endogenous inhibitor of brain TNF production and suggest an anti-inflammatory role for IL-10 in the central nervous system.},

Since IL-1{$\beta$} is typically activated in situations where TNF-{$\alpha$} is produced, it was hypothesized that IL-1{$\beta$} alters TNF-{$\alpha$}\textendash induced proinflammatory epithelial cell function by altering TNF receptor shedding and surface abundance. In this study, the impact of IL-1{$\beta$} on TNF-{$\alpha$}\textendash mediated chemokine production as well as TNF receptor surface expression and shedding were investigated from mouse pulmonary epithelial cells (MLE-15). Interleukin-1{$\beta$} rapidly and persistently enhanced soluble and surface TNFR2. These effects were dependent on TNFR1 expression. TNFR2 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) shifted IL-1{$\beta$} responses, significantly increasing surface and shed TNFR1 implying IL-1{$\beta$} selectively modifies TNF receptors depending on cellular receptor composition. mRNA expression of both receptors was unaltered by IL-1{$\beta$} up to 24 h or in combination with TNF-{$\alpha$} indicating effects were post-transcriptional. Interleukin-1{$\beta$} pretreatment enhanced TNF-{$\alpha$}\textendash induced macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and KC mRNA expression as well as MIP-2 and KC protein levels at the same time point analyzed. Experiments utilizing siRNA against the TNF receptors and a TNFR1 neutralizing antibody demonstrated TNF-{$\alpha$} induced MIP-2 through TNFR1, whereas both receptors may have contributed to KC production.

In the current study, we demonstrate a role for microglia in activity-dependent synaptic pruning in the postnatal retinogeniculate system. We show that microglia engulf presynaptic inputs during peak retinogeniculate pruning and that engulfment is dependent upon neural activity and the microglia-specific phagocytic signaling pathway, complement receptor 3(CR3)/C3. Furthermore, disrupting microglia-specific CR3/C3 signaling resulted in sustained deficits in synaptic connectivity. These results define a role for microglia during postnatal development and identify underlying mechanisms by which microglia engulf and remodel developing synapses.},

We showed that these rhythms have physiological consequences through alteration of hematopoietic cell recruitment and overall survival in models of septic shock, sickle cell vaso-occlusion, and BM transplantation.

This experiment investigated how changes in photoperiod and food availability affect investment in constitutive innate immunity and the acute phase response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections in captive red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra). Crossbills are reproductively flexible songbirds that specialize on an unpredictably available food resource and display temporal variation in immunity in the wild. Birds were separated into four treatments and exposed to long or short day lengths for 6~weeks before continuing on an ad libitum diet or experiencing a 20\% food reduction for 10\hspace{0.25em}days. Birds were un-injected or injected with LPS both before and after diet change. Innate immunity was quantified throughout the experiment to assess effects of photoperiod, food availability and their interactions on hemolysis-hemagglutination, haptoglobin, bacterial killing ability and leukocyte counts. Overall, increasing day length significantly increased both bacterial killing ability and leukocyte counts. Surprisingly, food restriction had little effect on the immune parameters, potentially owing to the 'low-cost' environment of captivity and suggesting that investment in innate immunity is prioritized and maintained whenever possible. LPS injections induced stereotypical sickness behaviors and increased bacterial killing ability in short day birds and complement activity (hemolysis) both before and after food restriction. These results demonstrate robust seasonal modulation of immune investment and an ability to maintain innate immunity in the face of limited resources in these temporally flexible songbirds.},

However, the importance of diurnal variability in the timing of influenza infection is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that endogenous rhythms affect survival in influenza infection. Circadian control of influenza infection is mediated by enhanced inflammation as proven by increased cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary transcriptomic profile and histology and is not attributable to viral burden. Better survival is associated with a time dependent preponderance of NK and NKT cells and lower proportion of inflammatory monocytes in the lung. Further, using a series of genetic mouse mutants, we elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying circadian gating of influenza infection.},

Systemic IL-1{$\beta$} could not induce significant blood TNF-{$\alpha$}, but induced CNS TNF-{$\alpha$} mRNA, while systemic TNF-{$\alpha$} could induce IL-1{$\beta$} in blood and brain. Differences between IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF-{$\alpha$}-induced hippocampal profiles, specifically for IL-6 and CXCL1 prompted a temporal analysis of systemic and central responses at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours, which revealed that IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF-{$\alpha$} both induced the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 but only IL-1{$\beta$} induced the pentraxin PTX3.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques develop more severe pathology than young adult animals, even though viral replication levels are similar. Comprehensive genomic analyses indicate that aged macaques have a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult macaques, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, with NF-{$\kappa$}B as central player, whereas expression of type I interferon (IFN)-{$\beta$} is reduced. Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques with type I IFN reduces pathology and diminishes pro-inflammatory gene expression, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels, without affecting virus replication in the lungs. Thus, ALI in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques developed as a result of an exacerbated innate host response. The anti-inflammatory action of type I IFN reveals a potential intervention strategy for virus-induced ALI., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection causes acute lung injury that may develop into the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in mostly elderly individuals. Although SARS-CoV infection can be fatal, most patients recover, suggesting that protective host responses are operational to combat the viral infection. Therefore, we used age as predisposing factor to obtain insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques developed significantly more pathology than young adult animals, which could not be contributed to differences in viral replication. Using comparative microarray analyses, it was shown that although the nature of the host response to SARS-CoV infection was similar in aged and young adult macaques, the severity was significantly different, with aged macaques displaying an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation. Interestingly, type I IFN-{$\beta$} mRNA levels correlated negatively with gross pathology. Therapeutic treatment of aged macaques with type I IFN reduced pathology without affecting virus replication. However, pro-inflammatory gene expression was significantly diminished. Thus, modulation of the host response by type I IFNs provides a promising outlook for novel intervention strategies.},

Due to the morbidity and mortality rates of viral encephalitides worldwide, there is a need to develop clinical treatments. Features of the central nervous system (CNS), including interconnected cell types and limited regeneration, provide unique challenges.

The cellular mechanism(s) underlying neurological recovery are not fully understood, but involve neuroimmune interactions that, until recently, primarily focused on microglia.

However, VSV encephalitis is not invariably fatal, suggesting that the CNS may contain a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) capable of inducing or propagating a protective antiviral immune response. To examine this possibility, we first characterized the cellular elements that infiltrate the brain as well as the activation status of resident microglia in the brains of normal and transgenic mice acutely ablated of peripheral dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo. VSV encephalitis was characterized by a pronounced infiltrate of myeloid cells (CD45highCD11b+) and CD8+ T cells containing a subset that was specific for the immunodominant VSV nuclear protein epitope. This T cell response correlated temporally with a rapid and sustained upregulation of MHC class I expression on microglia, whereas class II expression was markedly delayed. Ablation of peripheral DCs profoundly inhibited the inflammatory response as well as infiltration of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. Unexpectedly, the VSV-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-{$\gamma$}) response in the CNS remained intact in DC-deficient mice. Thus, both the inflammatory and certain components of the adaptive primary antiviral immune response in the CNS are dependent on peripheral DCs in vivo.},

After exposure to various stimuli, mononuclear phagocytes synthesize the inactive precursor (pro-IL-1{$\beta$}), which is then cleaved intracellularly by caspase-1 and secreted. A widely used method for in vitro secretion of IL-1{$\beta$} employs LPS-primed human peripheral blood monocytes. Subsequently, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is added to the cells in order to trigger the P2X7 receptor resulting in processing and secretion of mature IL-1{$\beta$}. However, it is often reported that secretion is due to cytotoxic effects of ATP with P2X7 receptor-activation-related cell death. We have challenged this concept and demonstrate IL-1{$\beta$} specific secretion, since there is no increase in cell death and IL-1{$\alpha$} and IL-18 are not released in the same cultures. More importantly we show that these conclusions can only be drawn under stringent experimental conditions.},

This remarkable glycolipid is essential for virtually all Gram-negative organisms and represents one of the conserved microbial structures responsible for activation of the innate immune system. For these reasons, the structure, function, and biosynthesis of LPS has been an area of intense research. The LPS of a number of bacteria is composed of three distinct regions \textemdash{} lipid A, a short core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen polysaccharide. The lipid A domain, also known as endotoxin, anchors the molecule in the outer membrane and is the bioactive component recognized by TLR4 during human infection. Overall, the biochemical synthesis of lipid A is a highly conserved process; however, investigation of the lipid A structures of various organisms shows an impressive amount of diversity. These differences can be attributed to the action of latent enzymes that modify the canonical lipid A molecule. Variation of the lipid A domain of LPS serves as one strategy utilized by Gram-negative bacteria to promote survival by providing resistance to components of the innate immune system and helping to evade recognition by TLR4. This review summarizes the biochemical machinery required for the production of diverse lipid A structures of human pathogens and how structural modification of endotoxin impacts pathogenesis.},

Although clock components show little protein sequence homology across phyla, multiple feedback loops and light inputs are universal features of clock networks 4, 5. Why have circadian systems evolved such a complex structure? All biological clocks entrain a set of regulatory genes to the environmental cycle, in order to correctly time the expression of many downstream processes. Thus the question becomes: What aspects of the environment, and of the desired downstream regulation, are demanding the observed complexity? To answer this, we have evolved gene regulatory networks in~silico, selecting for networks that correctly predict particular phases of the day under light/dark cycles. Gradually increasing the realism of the environmental cycles, we have tested the networks for the minimal characteristics of clocks observed in nature: oscillation under constant conditions, entrainment to light signals, and the presence of multiple feedback loops and light inputs. Realistic circadian gene networks are found to require a nontrivial combination of conditions, with seasonal differences in photoperiod as a necessary but not sufficient component.},

Wild type (wt) VSV infection did not induce type I IFN production in vitro or in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice; however IFN-{$\beta$} was detected in lungs, spleen, and serum within 24 h. The M protein mutant VSV, T1026R1 (also referred to as M51R), induced type I IFN production in vitro and in the CNS, with poor expression in spleens. In addition, VSV T1026R1 was not pathogenic to mice after intranasal infection, illustrating the importance of IFN in controlling VSV replication in the CNS. Experiments with chemical sympathectomy, sRAGE, and neutralizing antibody to VSV were performed to investigate the mechanism(s) utilized for induction of peripheral IFN; neither sRAGE infusion nor chemical sympathectomy had an effect on peripheral IFN production. In contrast, administration of neutralizing antibody (Ab) readily blocked the response. Infectious VSV was transiently present in lungs and spleens at 24 h post infection. The results are consistent with VSV traffic from the olfactory neuroepithelium to peripheral lymphoid organs hematogenously or via lymphatic circulation. These results suggest that VSV replicates to high titers in the brains of mice because of the lack of IFN production in the CNS after intranasal VSV infection. In contrast, replication of VSV in peripheral organs is controlled by the production of large amounts of IFN.},

The SCN is thought to drive peripheral oscillators by controlling neuronal and humoral signals that can entrain the peripheral clocks. Here, we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a proinflammatory compound known to have diverse biological effects, is able to act as an in vivo clock-resetting agent. We find that in cultured NIH3T3 fibroblasts, PGE2 is able to induce transient expression of Period 1 messenger RNA and the following circadian oscillation of clock gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intraperitoneal administration of PGE2 results in the phase shift of circadian gene expression in mouse peripheral tissues in a time-dependent manner. This phase shift is also induced by the EP1/EP3 agonist sulprostone but not by the EP2 agonist butaprost. The PGE2-induced phase shift is inhibited by the EP1 antagonist SC-51322. These results suggest that PGE2 acts as an in vivo clock-resetting factor by means of the EP1 subtype of PGE receptors.},

Research during the past few years has uncovered circadian circuits governing leukocyte migration between tissues, the magnitude of mucosal inflammation, the types of cytokines produced, and the severity of immune diseases. Other studies revealed how disruption of the circadian clock impairs immune function or how microbial products alter clock machinery.SummaryRevelations concerning the widespread impact of the circadian clock on immunity and homeostasis highlight how the timing of inflammatory challenges can dictate pathological outcomes and how the timing of therapeutic interventions likely determines clinical efficacy.

While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.

In contrast to all other environmental cues, photoperiod offers a highly predictive signal that can be reliably used to activate a seasonal adaptive programme at the correct time of year. Coupled to photoperiod sensing, it is apparent that many organisms have evolved innate long-term timekeeping systems, allowing reliable anticipation of forthcoming environmental changes. The fundamental biological processes giving rise to innate long-term timing, with which the photoperiod-sensing pathway engages, are not known for any organism. There is growing evidence that the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary, which acts as a primary transducer of photoperiodic input, may be the site of the innate long-term timer or ``circannual clock''. Current research has led to the proposition that the PT-specific thyrotroph may act as a seasonal calendar cell, driving both hypothalamic and pituitary endocrine circuits. Based on this research we propose that the mechanistic basis for the circannual rhythm appears to be deeply conserved, driven by a binary switching cell based accumulator, analogous to that proposed for development. We review the apparent conservation of function and pathways to suggest that these broad principles may apply across the vertebrate lineage and even share characteristics with processes driving seasonal adaptation in plants.},

However, various computational methods adopting different strategies for the identification of cycling transcripts usually yield inconsistent results even for the same dataset, making it challenging to choose the optimal method for a specific circadian study. To address this challenge, we evaluate 5 popular methods, including ARSER (ARS), COSOPT (COS), Fisher's G test (FIS), HAYSTACK (HAY), and JTK\_CYCLE (JTK), based on both simulated and empirical datasets. Our results show that increasing the number of total samples (through improving sampling frequency or lengthening the sampling time window) is beneficial for computational methods to accurately identify circadian transcripts and measure circadian phase. For a given number of total samples, higher sampling frequency is more important for HAY and JTK, and the longer sampling time window is more crucial for ARS and COS, as testified on simulated and empirical datasets from which circadian signals are computationally identified. In addition, the preference of higher sampling frequency or the longer sampling time window is also obvious for JTK, ARS, and COS in estimating circadian phases of simulated periodic profiles. Our results also indicate that attention should be paid to the significance threshold that is used for each method in selecting circadian genes, especially when analyzing the same empirical dataset with 2 or more methods. To summarize, for any study involving genome-wide identification of circadian genes from transcriptome data, our evaluation results provide suggestions for the selection of an optimal method based on specific goal and experimental design.},

Our recent findings indicate that there is microglial hyperactivity in the aged brain during an inflammatory challenge. The underlying cause of this amplified microglial response in the aged brain is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which age-associated impairments of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 in the brain contribute to exaggerated microglial activation after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we show that CX3CL1 protein was reduced in the brain of aged (18\textendash 22 mo) BALB/c mice compared to adult (3\textendash 6 mo) controls. CX3CL1 protein, however, was unaltered by LPS injection. Next, CX3CR1 levels were determined in microglia (CD11b+/CD45low) isolated by Percoll-density gradient separation at 4 and 24 h after LPS injection. Flow cytometric and mRNA analyses of these microglia showed that LPS-injection caused a marked decrease of CX3CR1 and a simultaneous increase of IL-1{$\beta$} at 4 h after LPS injection. While surface expression of CX3CR1 was enhanced on microglia of adult mice by 24 h, it was still significantly downregulated on a subset of microglia from aged mice. This protracted reduction of CX3CR1 corresponded with a delayed recovery from sickness behavior, prolonged IL-1{$\beta$} induction, and decreased TGF{$\beta$} expression in the aged brain. In the last set of studies BV2 microglia were used to determine effect of TGF{$\beta$} on CX3CR1. These results showed that TGF{$\beta$} enhanced CX3CR1 expression and attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-1{$\beta$} expression.},

Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function.

Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.},

  abstract = {TLRs are important components of the innate immune response. The role of the TLR signaling pathway in host defense against a natural viral infection has been largely unexplored. We found that mice lacking MyD88, an essential adaptor protein in TLR signaling pathway, were extremely sensitive to intranasal infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, and this susceptibility was dose dependent. We demonstrated that this increased susceptibility correlates with the impaired production of IFN-{$\alpha$} and defective induction and maintenance of neutralizing Ab. These studies outline the important role of the TLR signaling pathway in nasal mucosae-respiratory tracts-neuroepithelium environment in the protection against microbial pathogen infections. We believe that these results explain how the route of infection, probably by virtue of activating different cell populations, can lead to entirely different outcomes of infection based on the underlying genetics of the host.},

  abstract = {A key step in the analysis of circadian data is to make an accurate estimate of the underlying period. There are many different techniques and algorithms for determining period, all with different assumptions and with differing levels of complexity. Choosing which algorithm, which implementation and which measures of accuracy to use can offer many pitfalls, especially for the non-expert. We have developed the BioDare system, an online service allowing data-sharing (including public dissemination), data-processing and analysis. Circadian experiments are the main focus of BioDare hence performing period analysis is a major feature of the system. Six methods have been incorporated into BioDare: Enright and Lomb-Scargle periodograms, FFT-NLLS, mFourfit, MESA and Spectrum Resampling. Here we review those six techniques, explain the principles behind each algorithm and evaluate their performance. In order to quantify the methods' accuracy, we examine the algorithms against artificial mathematical test signals and model-generated mRNA data. Our re-implementation of each method in Java allows meaningful comparisons of the computational complexity and computing time associated with each algorithm. Finally, we provide guidelines on which algorithms are most appropriate for which data types, and recommendations on experimental design to extract optimal data for analysis.},
